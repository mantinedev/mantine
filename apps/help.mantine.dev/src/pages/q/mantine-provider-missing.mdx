<ErrorMessage error="@mantine/core: MantineProvider was not found in component tree, make sure you have it in your app." />

The error above occurs in the following cases:

- You are do not have `MantineProvider` in your app at all
- You are rendering Mantine components outside of `MantineProvider` context
- You have different versions of `@mantine/*` packages in your application.
  For example, you have `@mantine/core@7.0.0` and `@mantine/dates@7.1.0` installed.
- There was an issue during packages installation. Usually this happens with pnpm.
- Your app has multiple instances of `@mantine/core` package in the bundle. This may
  happen if your project is a monorepo and you have multiple node_modules folders.

Steps to resolve the issue:

- Make sure that you have `MantineProvider` in your app and it wraps all Mantine components.
- Make sure that you have only one version of `@mantine/core` in your app. If you are using
  monorepo, make sure all packages depend on the same version of `@mantine/core`.
- Reinstall dependencies by removing `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` or
  `yarn install` again.
- If you still have issues, you can use [one of the official templates](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/#get-started-with-a-template) as reference.
