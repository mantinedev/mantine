## data-mantine-color-scheme attribute

Most Mantine styles rely on the `data-mantine-color-scheme`
attribute being present on the root element of the application.
If it is not there, your application will look broken and it may
seem that styles are not applied at all. This is not the case – styles
are applied, but there is no `data-mantine-color-scheme` attribute
to match the selectors.

By default, the `data-mantine-color-scheme` attribute is added automatically
by the `ColorSchemeScript` and `MantineProvider` components. Both of them
are JavaScript components and require JavaScript to work.

## Adding support for disabled JavaScript

If you are planning to support users with disabled JavaScript, you
need to define the `data-mantine-color-scheme` attribute manually on
the root element of your application (usually the `html` element).

```html
<html data-mantine-color-scheme="light">
<!-- ... rest of your application -->
```

Note that you can only use `light` or `dark` values for `data-mantine-color-scheme`
in this case. The `auto` value is not supported without JavaScript.
