## Community packages

Mantine does not provide DataGrid component, but there are several community packages that you can use:

- [Mantine React Table](https://www.mantine-react-table.com/#)
- [Mantine Data Grid](https://kuechlin.github.io/mantine-data-grid/#/)
- [Mantine DataTable](https://icflorescu.github.io/mantine-datatable/)

If none of the packages above fits your needs, you can build a custom
DataGrid component with [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/)
and [Table](https://mantine.dev/core/table/) component from Mantine.

## Is it planned to add DataGrid component to Mantine?

The DataGrid component is complex and requires a lot of maintenance.
As of now (January 2024), it is not planned to add native DataGrid component
to Mantine in the near future.
