## How Mantine styles work

All `@mantine/*` packages that include styles export `@mantine/*/styles.css`
file which includes all the styles for the package.
These files are handled by your framework/build tool (Next.js, Vite, Remix, etc.)
and included in the final bundle.

Most of Mantine styles (99%+) have low specificity (class selectors) to allow
easy customization and overrides.

## Styles overriding conflicts

In some cases, you might experience conflicts when Mantine styles override your
styles. It happens when your styles have the same or lower specificity than
Mantine styles and Mantine styles are imported after your styles. Usually, this
issue can be resolved by changing the import order:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong order – Mantine styles override your styles
import './styles.css';
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
```

```tsx
// ✅ Correct order – your styles override Mantine styles
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
import './styles.css';
```

## CSS layers

Some frameworks/build tools might not allow you to fully control styles order.
This usually happens when the framework has a bug/limitation or when you use
specific features that mess up styles order (for example dynamic components imports).

In this case the only solution is to use [CSS layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer).
The `@layer` CSS at-rule is used to declare a cascade layer and can also be used to define the order of precedence in case of multiple cascade layers.
When styles are wrapped with `@layer` at-rule, their specificity is automatically reduced
compared to regular styles.

In addition to regular styles, `@mantine/*` packages also provide `@mantine/*/styles.layer.css`
in which all selectors are wrapped with `@layer mantine {}`. To use CSS layers in your application,
simply replace `@mantine/*/styles.css` imports with `@mantine/*/styles.layer.css`:

```tsx
import '@mantine/core/styles.layer.css';
```
