## How can I build the same footer?

- Give the footer a fixed position with `position: fixed` and `bottom: 0` properties.
- Create a div element that will contain all content except the footer.
- Set `min-height: 100vh` on the content container to make sure that the footer is always covered by the content.
- Make sure that your content container has a background color.
- Done! You have a footer at the bottom of the page.
