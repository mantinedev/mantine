import { Layout } from '@/layout';
import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.GettingStartedCharts);

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@mantine/charts recharts" />

After installation, import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
// ‼️ import charts styles after core package styles
import '@mantine/charts/styles.css';
```

## Do not forget to import styles

Followed the installation instructions above but something is not working
(misplaced tooltips or no colors)?
You've fallen into the trap of not importing chart styles!
To fix the issue, import chart styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@mantine/charts/styles.css';
```

## Based on recharts

Most of the components in the `@mantine/charts` package are based on the [recharts](https://recharts.org/) library.
If you need advanced features that are not covered in the `@mantine/charts`
documentation, refer to the [recharts documentation](https://recharts.org/en-US/api) for more information.
