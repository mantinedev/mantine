## Migration guide

This changelog covers breaking changes and new features in Mantine 8.0.
To migrate your application to Mantine 8.0, follow [7.x → 8.x migration guide](/guides/7x-to-8x).

## Granular global styles exports

Global styles are now splitted between 3 files:

- `baseline.css` – a minimal CSS reset, sets `box-sizing: border-box` and changes font properties
- `default-css-variables.css` – contains all CSS variables generated from the default theme
- `global.css` – global classes used in Mantine components

If you previously imported individual styles from `@mantine/core` package, you need to update imports
to use new files:

```tsx
import '@mantine/core/styles/baseline.css';
import '@mantine/core/styles/default-css-variables.css';
import '@mantine/core/styles/global.css';
```

If you imported `@mantine/core/styles.css`, no changes are required –
all new files are already included in `styles.css`.

## Menu with submenus

[Menu](/core/menu) component now supports submenus:

<Demo data={MenuDemos.sub} demoProps={{ defaultExpanded: false }} />

## Popover hideDetached

[Popover](/core/popover) component now supports `hideDetached` prop to configure how the dropdown behaves when the target
element is hidden with styles (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, etc.),
removed from the DOM, or when the target element is scrolled out of the viewport.

By default, `hideDetached` is enabled – the dropdown is hidden with the target element.
You can change this behavior with `hideDetached={false}`. To see the difference, try to scroll
the root element of the following demo:

<Demo data={PopoverDemos.hideDetached} demoProps={{ defaultExpanded: false }} />

## Date values as strings

All `@mantine/dates` components now use date strings in `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`
format instead of `Date` objects. This change was made to resolve issues related to timezones
– now the output of all `@mantine/dates` components does not include any timezone specific information.
Follow [7.x → 8.x migration guide](/guides/7x-to-8x) to learn how to update the code to use new string values.

Example of using [DatePicker](/dates/date-picker) component with string values:

<Demo data={DatePickerDemos.usage} />

## DatesProvider timezone

`DatesProvider` component no longer supports `timezone` option – all `@mantine/dates`
components now use strings in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` format as values and do not contain
timezone information.

If you need to handle timezones in your application, you can use a dedicated dates library
([dayjs](https://day.js.org/), [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/), [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/))
to update timezone values.

Example of using Mantine components with [dayjs](https://day.js.org/):

```tsx
import dayjs from 'dayjs';
import { DatePicker } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<string | null>('2022-08-21');

  // Mantine components use strings as values, you can pass these
  // strings to a dates library of your choice to assign timezone
  const dateWithTimeZone = dayjs(value).tz("America/Toronto").toDate();

  return <DatePicker value={value} onChange={setValue} />;
}
```

## TimePicker component

New [TimePicker](/dates/time-picker) component is an alternative to
[TimeInput](/dates/time-input) that offers more features. It supports 24-hour and 12-hour formats,
dropdown with hours, minutes and seconds, and more.

<Demo data={TimePickerDemos.withDropdown} />

## DateTimePicker component changes

[DateTimePicker](/dates/date-time-picker) component now uses [TimePicker](/dates/time-picker) under
the hood instead of [TimeInput](/dates/time-input). You can now use all [TimePicker](/dates/time-picker)
features with [DateTimePicker](/dates/date-time-picker) component.

Prop `timeInputProps` is no longer available, to pass props down to the underlying [TimePicker](/dates/time-picker)
you need to use `timePickerProps` prop.

Example of enabling dropdown and setting `12h` format for time picker:

<Demo data={DateTimePickerDemos.timePickerProps} />

## TimeValue component

New [TimeValue](/dates/time-value) component can be used to display a formatted time string
with similar formatting options to [TimePicker](/dates/time-picker) component.

<Demo data={TimeValueDemos.usage} />

## TimeGrid component

New [TimeGrid](/dates/time-grid) component allows to capture time value from the user with a
predefined set of time slots:

<Demo data={TimeGridDemos.usage} />

## Heatmap component

New [Heatmap](/charts/heatmap) component allows to display data in a calendar heatmap format:

<Demo data={HeatmapDemos.tooltip} />

## CodeHighlight changes

[@mantine/code-highlight](/x/code-highlight) package no longer depends options
[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). Instead it now provides a new API based
on adapters that allows using any syntax highlighter of your choice. Out of the box
`@mantine/code-highlight` provides adapters for [shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) and
[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).

To learn about the migration process and how to use new adapters API, check the
updated [CodeHighlight documentation](/x/code-highlight) and [7.x → 8.x migration guide](/guides/7x-to-8x).

## CodeHighlight with shiki

You can now use [CodeHighlight](/x/code-highlight) component with [shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/).

[Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) library provides the most advanced syntax highlighting
for TypeScript and CSS/Sass code. It uses textmate grammars to highlight code (same as in VSCode).
Shiki adapter is recommended if you need to highlight advanced TypeScript (generics, jsx nested in props) or CSS code (custom syntaxes, newest features).
Shiki adapter is used for all code highlighting in Mantine documentation.

To use shiki adapter you need to install `shiki` package:

<InstallScript packages="shiki" />

Then wrap your app with `CodeHighlightAdapterProvider` and provide `createShikiAdapter` as `adapter` prop:

```tsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { CodeHighlightAdapterProvider, createShikiAdapter } from '@mantine/code-highlight';

// Shiki requires async code to load the highlighter
async function loadShiki() {
  const { getHighlighter } = await import('shiki');
  const shiki = await getHighlighter({
    langs: ['tsx', 'scss', 'html', 'bash', 'json'],
    themes: [],
  });

  return shiki;
}

const shikiAdapter = createShikiAdapter(loadShiki);

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider>
      <CodeHighlightAdapterProvider adapter={shikiAdapter}>
        {/* Your app here */}
      </CodeHighlightAdapterProvider>
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

After that, you can use `CodeHighlight` component in your application:

<Demo data={CodeHighlightDemos.usage} />

## Carousel changes

[@mantine/carousel](/x/carousel) package was updated to use the latest version of
`embla-carousel-react` package. This update includes breaking changes:

- `speed` and `draggable` props were removed – they are no longer supported by `embla-carousel-react`
- It is now required to install both `embla-carousel` and `embla-carousel-react` packages explicitly
- `useAnimationOffsetEffect` hook was removed – the issue it addressed was fixed in `embla-carousel-react`
- `Embla` type export was removed, you should use `EmblaCarouselType` from `embla-carousel` instead
- Props that were previously passed to embla are now grouped under `emblaOptions` prop

Follow the [7.x → 8.x migration guide](/guides/7x-to-8x) to update your application to use the latest version of `@mantine/carousel`.

## Switch withThumbIndicator

[Switch](/core/switch) component styles were updated to include indicator inside the thumb.
You can change it by setting `withThumbIndicator` prop:

<Demo data={SwitchDemos.configurator} />

## Other changes

- [Kbd](/core/kbd) component now supports `size` prop
- [DateInput](/dates/date-input) component no longer supports `preserveTime` prop, use different component to capture time values
- [ScrollArea](/core/scroll-area) component no longer has forced `display: table` styles on the wrapper element of the content. It also now supports `content` Styles API selector to apply styles to the content element.
- [Image](/core/image) component no longer includes `flex: 0` styles by default
- [SegmentedControl](/core/segmented-control) default height values were changed to match sizes of [Input](/core/input) components
- Type of `wrapperProps` prop in all components that support it (`Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Chip`, most inputs) was changed to more strict type
- [Portal](/core/portal) component now has `reuseTargetNode` prop enabled by default
- [use-form](/form/use-form) `setFieldValue` handler types are now more strict
- [Menu.Item](/core/menu) no longer has `data-hovered` attribute, use `:hover` and `:focus` selectors instead to apply styles
- [use-os](/hooks/use-os) now supports Chrome OS detection, its return type now includes `chromeos` value in the union
