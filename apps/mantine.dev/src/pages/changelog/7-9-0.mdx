## @mantine/emotion package

New [@mantine/emotion](/styles/emotion) package is now available to simplify migration
from [6.x to 7.x](/guides/6x-to-7x/). It includes `createStyles` function and additional
functionality for `sx` and `styles` props for all components similar to what was available
in `@mantine/core` package in v6.

If you still haven't migrated to 7.x because of the change in styling approach, you can now
have a smoother transition by using `@mantine/emotion` package. To learn more about the package,
visit the [documentation page](/styles/emotion) and updated [6.x to 7.x migration guide](/guides/6x-to-7x/).

## React 18.3 support

All `@mantine/*` components and hooks have been updated to support React 18.3. It is
recommended to update your application as well to prepare for the upcoming [React 19 release](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19).

## use-field hook

New [use-field](/form/use-field) hook is now available in `@mantine/form` package.
It can be used as a simpler alternative to [use-form](/form/use-form) hook to manage state of a single input without the need to create a form.
The hook supports most of `use-form` hook features: validation with function, touched and
dirty state, error message, validation on change/blur and more.

<Demo data={FieldDemos.validateOnChange} />

`use-field` hook also supports async validation:

<Demo data={FieldDemos.asyncValidation} />

## Custom PostCSS mixins

You can now define custom mixins that are not included in [mantine-postcss-preset](/styles/postcss-preset) by specifying them
in the `mixins` option. To learn about mixins syntax, follow [postcss-mixins documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins#readme).
Note that this feature is available in `postcss-preset-mantine` starting from version 1.15.0.

Example of adding `clearfix` and `circle` mixins:

```tsx
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-preset-mantine': {
      autoRem: true,
      mixins: {
        clearfix: {
          '&::after': {
            content: '""',
            display: 'table',
            clear: 'both',
          },
        },
        circle: (_mixin, size) => ({
          borderRadius: '50%',
          width: size,
          height: size,
        }),
      },
    },
    // ... Other plugins
  },
};
```

Then you can use these mixins in your styles:

```scss
.demo {
  @mixin clearfix;
  @mixin circle 100px;
}
```

## use-matches hook

New `use-matches` hook exported from `@mantine/core` is an alternative to [use-media-query](/hooks/use-media-query/)
if you need to match multiple media queries and values. It accepts an object with media queries as keys and
values at given breakpoint as values.

Note that `use-matches` hook uses the same logic as [use-media-query](/hooks/use-media-query/) under the hood,
it is not recommended to be used as a primary source of responsive styles, especially if you have ssr in your application.

In the following example:

- Starting from `theme.breakpoints.lg`, color will be `red.9`
- Between `theme.breakpoints.sm` and `theme.breakpoints.lg`, color will be `orange.9`
- Below `theme.breakpoints.sm`, color will be `blue.9`

<Demo data={StylesDemos.useMatchesHook} />

## BarChart value label

[BarChart](/charts/bar-chart) now supports `withBarValueLabel` prop that allows
displaying value label on top of each bar:

<Demo data={BarChartDemos.barValueLabel} />
