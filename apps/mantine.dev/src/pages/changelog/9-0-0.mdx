## Migration guide

This changelog covers breaking changes and new features in Mantine 9.0.
To migrate your application to Mantine 9.0, follow [8.x → 9.x migration guide](/guides/8x-to-9x).

## React 19

Starting from Mantine 9.0.0, React 19 is required. Most components continue
working with React 18 or work with warnings. It is not recommended to use Mantine
9.x if you cannot update React to version 19 in your project.

Components and hooks impacted by this change:

- [Accordion](/core/accordion)
- [Collapse](/core/collapse)
- [use-mouse](/hooks/use-mouse)
- [use-move](/hooks/use-move)
- [use-hover](/hooks/use-hover)
- [use-resize-observer](/hooks/use-resize-observer)
- [use-mutation-observer](/hooks/use-mutation-observer)
- [use-fullscreen](/hooks/use-fullscreen)

## use-floating-window hook

New [use-floating-window](/hooks/use-floating-window) hook allows creating floating draggable
elements:

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useFloatingWindowUsageDemo} />

## FloatingWindow component

[FloatingWindow](/core/floating-window) provides component API for [use-floating-window](/hooks/use-floating-window) hook:

<Demo data={FloatingWindowDemos.usage} />

## OverflowList component

New [OverflowList](/core/overflow-list) component displays list of items and collapses the overflowing items into a single element:

<Demo data={OverflowListDemos.usage} />

## Card horizontal orientation

[Card](/core/card) component now supports horizontal orientation:

<Demo data={CardDemos.horizontal} demoProps={{ defaultExpanded: false }} />

## Checkbox.Group and Switch.Group maxSelectedValues

[Checkbox.Group](/core/checkbox) and [Switch.Group](/core/switch) now support `maxSelectedValues` prop to limit the number of selected values.
When the limit is reached, the remaining controls are disabled and cannot be selected.

<Demo data={CheckboxDemos.maxSelectedValues} />

## Tiptap 3 only

Starting from Mantine 9.0, Tiptap 3 is required for [@mantine/tiptap](/core/tiptap).
You can follow the [migration guide](/guides/tiptap-3-migration) to update Tiptap in your project.

## Recharts 3 only

Starting from Mantine 9.0, Recharts 3 is required for [@mantine/charts](/charts/getting-started/).
There are no breaking changes required on your side besides updating Recharts package.

## Other changes

- `@mantine/form` package no longer exports schema resolvers, use [dedicated packages](/form/schema-validation/) instead
- [Text](/core/text) and [Anchor](/core/anchor) components no longer accept `color` prop, use `c` style prop instead
- [PasswordInput](/core/password-input) component visibility toggle icon was updated
- [Popover](/core/popover) and [Tooltip](/core/tooltip) components no longer accept `positionDependencies` prop, it is no longer required
- [TypographyStylesProvider](/core/typography) component was renamed to [Typography](/core/typography)
- [Checkbox](/core/checkbox) component now supports `readOnly` and `withErrorStyles` props
- [Checkbox.Group](/core/checkbox/#checkboxgroup-with-formdata) and [Switch.Group](/core/switch/#switchgroup-with-formdata) can now be used in uncontrolled forms and can be accessed through `FormData`
- [use-fullscreen](/hooks/use-fullscreen) hook was split into two hooks: `useFullscreenElement` and `useFullscreenDocument`
- [use-media-query](/hooks/use-media-query) hook no longer includes fallback for old Safari versions (iOS 13 and earlier, released before 2019)
- [use-resize-observer](/hooks/use-resize-observer) now uses the new callback ref approach. The new approach makes hook usable with dynamic node changes. This change might be breaking, validate hook usage in your application.
- [use-mouse](/hooks/use-mouse) hook now uses the new callback ref approach to resolve the issue with stale refs. The previous hook functionality was split into two hooks: `use-mouse` (for ref) and `use-mouse-position` (for document).
- [use-mutation-observer](/hooks/use-mutation-observer) hook now uses the new callback ref approach. The new approach makes hook usable with dynamic node changes. Additionally, a new `useMutationObserverTarget` hook was added for observing external target elements.
- `@mantine/hooks` types were renamed for consistency:
  - `UseScrollSpyReturnType` → `UseScrollSpyReturnValue`
  - `StateHistory` → `UseStateHistoryValue`
  - `OS` → `UseOSReturnValue`
