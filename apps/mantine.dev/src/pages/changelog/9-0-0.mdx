## Migration guide

This changelog covers breaking changes and new features in Mantine 9.0.
To migrate your application to Mantine 9.0, follow [8.x → 9.x migration guide](/guides/8x-to-9x).

## React 19

Starting from Mantine 9.0.0, React 19 is required. Most components continue
working with React 18 or work with warnings. It is not recommended to use Mantine
9.x if you cannot update React to version 19 in your project.

Components impacted by this change:

- [Accordion](/core/accordion)
- [Collapse](/core/collapse)

elements:

<Demo data={FloatingWindowDemos.usage} />
