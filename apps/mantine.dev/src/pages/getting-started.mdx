# Getting started

## Get started with a template

The easiest way to get started is to use one of the templates.
All templates include required dependencies and pre-configured settings.
Some templates also include additional features like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), etc.

All templates include only `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks` packages,
if you need additional `@mantine/*` packages follow installation instructions
of the package you want to use.

To get started with a template, open it on GitHub and click on the "Use this template"
button. Note that you need to be logged in to your GitHub account to use this feature.
If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can find a detailed instruction on how to
bootstrap a project from a template [on this page](/templates-usage).

## Community templates

Community templates are created and maintained by the community. These templates
usually include additional features and third-party integrations. You are welcome
to share your template with the community by following [this guide](/submit-template/).

## Framework guide

Follow one of the guides below to get started with Mantine and your preferred framework.
Note that usually it is better to start a new project with a template. Use guides if you want
to add Mantine to an existing project or if enjoy doing things manually.

<FrameworksGuides />

## Get started without framework

<PackagesInstallation />

Install PostCSS plugins and [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset):

<InstallScript
  packages="postcss postcss-preset-mantine postcss-simple-vars"
  dev
/>

> **PostCSS without framework**
>
> Note that if you are using a framework that is not officially supported, you may need
> to set up PostCSS manually. Refer to the framework documentation to learn how to do that.
> For example, if you are using Webpack, you will need to install and configure [postcss-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/postcss-loader/).

Create `postcss.config.cjs` file at the root of your application with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-preset-mantine': {},
    'postcss-simple-vars': {
      variables: {
        'mantine-breakpoint-xs': '36em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-sm': '48em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-md': '62em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-lg': '75em',
        'mantine-breakpoint-xl': '88em',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Add styles imports to the root of your application. Usually styles are imported
once in the root file. For example, if you are using Next.js with pages router,
you can import styles in `_app.tsx` file:

```tsx
// core styles are required for all packages
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';

// other css files are required only if
// you are using components from the corresponding package
// import '@mantine/dates/styles.css';
// import '@mantine/dropzone/styles.css';
// import '@mantine/code-highlight/styles.css';
// ...
```

Wrap your application with [MantineProvider](/theming/mantine-provider/):

```tsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const theme = createTheme({
  /** Put your mantine theme override here */
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your app here */}
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

If your application has server side rendering, add [ColorSchemeScript](/theming/color-schemes)
to the `<head />` of your application:

```tsx
import { ColorSchemeScript } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charSet="UTF-8" />
        <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
        />
        <title>My awesome app</title>

        <ColorSchemeScript />
      </head>
      <body>{/* Your app here */}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

All set! Now you can use Mantine components in your application.

## Set up VS Code

By default, VS Code does not recognize postcss syntax, you need to install
[PostCSS Intellisense and Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vunguyentuan.vscode-postcss)
to enable syntax highlighting and suppress variables (`$variable`) errors.

To get CSS variables autocomplete, install [CSS Variable Autocomplete extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vunguyentuan.vscode-css-variables).
Then create `.vscode/settings.json` file in the root folder of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "cssVariables.lookupFiles": [
    "**/*.css",
    "**/*.scss",
    "**/*.sass",
    "**/*.less",
    "node_modules/@mantine/core/styles.css"
  ]
}
```

## Mantine for Figma

Design files are not used during the development process of the library – there are no official
Figma or Sketch files. However, there are community-driven projects that provide Figma components
based on Mantine. Note that these projects are not maintained by Mantine team, and we do not guarantee
that they are up-to-date with the latest Mantine version.
