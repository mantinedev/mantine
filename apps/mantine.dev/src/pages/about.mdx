# About Mantine

Mantine is a React components library focused on providing great user and developer experience.
Mantine development was started in January 2021 and the 1.0 version was released on [May 3rd, 2021](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/releases/tag/1.0.0),
and since then, [more than 200 releases have been published](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/releases).

## Browser support

Mantine is tested on real devices in the following browsers before each minor and major release: Chrome, Safari, Firefox,
Edge, Safari for iOS, Chrome for Android. Testing in other browsers is not performed.

All Mantine components and hooks were tested to work in the following browsers:

- Chromium browsers 108+ – Chrome, Edge, Chrome for Android, etc.
- Firefox 101+
- Safari 15.4+
- IE (any version) is not supported

Browsers version that support [:where selector](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where) and [@layer directive](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_layer)
features that are required for Mantine styles (any versions below may have major issues with styles):

- Chromium browsers 99+ – Chrome, Edge, Chrome for Android, etc.
- Firefox 97+
- Safari 15.4+

Mantine components use the following CSS features:

- [:where selector](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where) in all components
- [@layer directive](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_layer) in all styles
- [:has pseudo-class](https://caniuse.com/css-has) in several components for non-critical styles
- [flexbox gap](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap) in most components
- [dvh units](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_length_viewport_percentage_units_dynamic) in several components
- [color-mix](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_color-mix) function is not used in any components by default, but can be used on your side with [alpha](styles/postcss-preset/#alpha-function) PostCSS function.
- [aspect-ratio](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_aspect-ratio) CSS property is used in several components
- [container queries](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) are used in several components if the option is explicitly enabled via prop

All CSS features listed above are supported in all modern browsers (90% or more of global usage as of January 2024).

If you need to support older browsers, you should:

- check the component `Browser support` section before usage and decide whether this component will work for your case
- install corresponding polyfills that are required for hook/component to work in older browsers
- check that component works in those browsers on your side (we do not test Mantine in browsers that are older than those that are listed above)
