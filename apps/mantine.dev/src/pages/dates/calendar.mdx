import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.Calendar);

## Usage

Use the `Calendar` component to create custom date pickers if the [DatePicker](/dates/date-picker/)
component does not meet your requirements. `Calendar` supports all [DatePicker](/dates/date-picker/)
props and some additional props that are listed in the props table – check it out to learn about all component features.

By default, `Calendar` works the same way as the [DatePicker](/dates/date-picker/) component but does not
include any logic for date selection:

## Custom date pickers

Use `Calendar` as a base for custom date pickers. For example, you can create a date picker
that allows users to pick three or fewer dates:

<Demo data={CalendarDemos.picker} />

Another custom date picker example – week picker:

<Demo data={CalendarDemos.weekPicker} />

## Static prop

Set the `static` prop to display a calendar that users cannot interact with.
This is useful when you want to display data in a calendar view but do
not want it to be interactive.

<Demo data={CalendarDemos.isStatic} />
