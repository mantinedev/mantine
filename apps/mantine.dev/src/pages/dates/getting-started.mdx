import {

import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.GettingStartedDates);

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@mantine/dates dayjs" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
// ‼️ import dates styles after core package styles
import '@mantine/dates/styles.css';
```

## Do not forget to import styles

Followed the installation instructions above but something is not working
(calendars and date pickers have no styles and look broken)?
You've fallen into the trap of not importing dates styles!
To fix this issue, import dates styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@mantine/dates/styles.css';
```

## Usage

After installing the `@mantine/dates` package and importing styles, you can use all components from it:

<Demo data={DatePickerInputDemos.usage} />

## dayjs

`@mantine/dates` components use [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) under the hood for date manipulations and formatting.
dayjs is a required dependency – you cannot change it to another date library. If you want to use a different
date library in your application, you will need to install it separately.

## DatesProvider

The `DatesProvider` component lets you set various settings that are shared across all
components exported from the `@mantine/dates` package. `DatesProvider` supports the following settings:

- `locale` – dayjs locale. Note that you also need to import the corresponding locale module from dayjs. The default value is `en`.
- `firstDayOfWeek` – a number from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. The default value is 1 – Monday.
- `weekendDays` – an array of numbers from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. The default value is `[0, 6]` – Saturday and Sunday.
- `consistentWeeks` – boolean. If `true`, every month will have 6 weeks. The default value is `false`.

<Demo data={DatesProviderDemos.usage} />

## Consistent weeks

If you want to avoid layout shifts, set `consistentWeeks: true` in the `DatesProvider` settings.
This will ensure that every month has 6 weeks, even if outside days are not in the same month.

<Demo data={DatesProviderDemos.consistentWeeks} />

## Custom parse format

Some components like [DateInput](/dates/date-input) require the [custom parse format](https://day.js.org/docs/en/plugin/custom-parse-format)
dayjs plugin. You need to extend dayjs with this plugin before using components that require it. Note that
this is usually done once in your application root file, so you don't need to do it every time you use the component.

```tsx
import dayjs from 'dayjs';
import customParseFormat from 'dayjs/plugin/customParseFormat';

dayjs.extend(customParseFormat);
```

## Localization and server components

To add localization, you must import `import 'dayjs/locale/x';` in your application (`x` is the locale name)
and set `locale` either on `DatesProvider` or on each component individually.

Example of setting the locale on DatesProvider:

```tsx
import 'dayjs/locale/ru';

import { DatesProvider } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <DatesProvider settings={{ locale: 'ru' }}>
      {/* Your app  */}
    </DatesProvider>
  );
}
```

The code above works in all environments, except Next.js app router.
If you are using Next.js app router, you must add `'use client';` to the
top of the file where you are importing `dayjs/locale/x` – locale data
is required both on client and server.

```tsx
'use client';

import 'dayjs/locale/ru';

import { DatesProvider } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <DatesProvider settings={{ locale: 'ru' }}>
      {/* Your app  */}
    </DatesProvider>
  );
}
```
