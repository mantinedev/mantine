# Icon libraries with Mantine

You can use any icon library with Mantine components. The most popular options are:

- [Tabler icons](https://tabler-icons.io/)
- [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/)
- [Radix icons](https://icons.radix-ui.com/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/use-with/react)

## Tabler icons

[Tabler icons](https://tabler-icons.io/) are used in Mantine demos, documentation,
and some `@mantine/` packages depend on them. If you don't know which icon library
to use, we recommend [Tabler icons](https://tabler-icons.io/).

## Icon size

Most icon libraries support a `size` prop (or similar `width` and `height` props) that allows you to change the
icon width and height. Usually, it's a number in pixels.

> **rem units in size prop**
>
> The icon `size` prop is usually converted to `width` and `height` props under the hood.
> If you set `size={16}` it will be converted to `width="16"` and `height="16"` attributes
> on the svg element.
>
> You can use rem units in the `size` prop: `size="1rem"` will be converted to `width="1rem"` and `height="1rem"`,
> but it's not recommended as it's prohibited by the SVG standard – some browsers (Firefox) will show a warning in the console.

## Custom icons

We recommend using icons as React components. In this case, you'll be able to use
`currentColor` in the `fill` and `stroke` props. This will change the icon color based on the context
it's used in.
