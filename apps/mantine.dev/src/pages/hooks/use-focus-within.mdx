import { HooksDemos } from '@docs/demos';
import { Layout } from '@/layout';
import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.useFocusWithin);

## Usage

The `use-focus-within` hook detects if any element within another element has focus.
It works the same way as the `:focus-within` CSS selector:

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useFocusWithinDemo} />

## Definition

```tsx
interface UseFocusWithinOptions {
  onFocus?: (event: FocusEvent) => void;
  onBlur?: (event: FocusEvent) => void;
}

interface UseFocusWithinReturnValue<T extends HTMLElement = any> {
  ref: React.RefCallback<T | null>;
  focused: boolean;
}

function useFocusWithin<T extends HTMLElement = any>(
  options?: UseFocusWithinOptions,
): UseFocusWithinReturnValue<T>
```

## Exported types

`UseFocusWithinOptions` and `UseFocusWithinReturnValue` types are exported from the `@mantine/hooks` package;
you can import them in your application:

```tsx
import type { UseFocusWithinOptions, UseFocusWithinReturnValue } from '@mantine/hooks';
```
