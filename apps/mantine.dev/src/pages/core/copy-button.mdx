## Usage

`CopyButton` is based on [use-clipboard](/hooks/use-clipboard/) hook.
Its children is a function that receives an object with the following properties:

- `copied` – boolean value that indicates that a given value was recently copied to the clipboard, it resets after a given timeout (defaults to 500ms)
- `copy` – function that should be called to copy given value to clipboard

## Security

Due to security reasons `CopyButton` component will not work in iframes and may not work with local files opened with `file://` protocol
(component will work fine with local websites that are using `http://` protocol). You can learn more about `navigator.clipboard` [here](https://web.dev/async-clipboard/).

## Timeout

You can provide a custom `copied` reset `timeout`:

<Demo data={CopyButtonDemos.timeout} />

<ServerComponentsIncompatible component="CopyButton" />
