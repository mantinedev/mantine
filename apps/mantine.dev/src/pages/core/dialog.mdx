import { DialogDemos } from '@docs/demos';
import { Layout } from '@/layout';
import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.Dialog);

## Usage

`Dialog` is a simplified version of the [Modal](/core/modal/) component.
It does not include most of the accessibility and usability [Modal](/core/modal/) features:

- Focus trap is not available
- Does not close on click outside
- Does not have an overlay

Use `Dialog` to attract attention with non-important information or actions.
For example, you can create an email subscription form:

<Demo data={DialogDemos.usage} />

## Change position

`Dialog` is rendered in [Portal](/core/portal/) and has a fixed position. Set the `position` prop to control the dialog's position:

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <>
      <Dialog position={{ top: 20, left: 20 }} opened>
        Dialog in top left corner
      </Dialog>
      <Dialog position={{ bottom: 20, left: 20 }} opened>
        Dialog in bottom left corner
      </Dialog>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility

`Dialog` is not accessible and most likely will not be announced by screen readers.
Make sure you do not put any important information in it. In most cases it would be better
to select [Modal](/core/modal/), [Drawer](/core/drawer/) or [Notifications](/x/notifications/).
