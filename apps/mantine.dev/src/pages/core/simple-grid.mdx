## Usage

`SimpleGrid` is a responsive grid system with equal-width columns.
It uses CSS grid layout. If you need to set different widths for columns, use
[Grid](/core/grid) component instead.

## spacing and verticalSpacing props

`spacing` prop is used both for horizontal and vertical spacing if `verticalSpacing` is not set:

```tsx
import { SimpleGrid } from '@mantine/core';

// `spacing` is used for both horizontal and vertical spacing
const Spacing = () => <SimpleGrid spacing="xl" />;

// `spacing` is used for horizontal spacing, `verticalSpacing` for vertical
const VerticalSpacing = () => (
  <SimpleGrid spacing="xl" verticalSpacing="lg" />
);
```

## Responsive props

`cols`, `spacing` and `verticalSpacing` props support object notation for responsive values,
it works the same way as [style props](/styles/style-props): the object may have `base`, `xs`,
`sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl` key, and values from those keys will be applied according to current
viewport width.

In the following example, `cols={{ base: 1, sm: 2, lg: 5 }}` means:

- 1 column if viewport width is less than `sm` breakpoint
- 2 columns if viewport width is between `sm` and `lg` breakpoints
- 5 columns if viewport width is greater than `lg` breakpoint

Same logic applies to `spacing` and `verticalSpacing` props.

## Container queries

To use [container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries)
instead of media queries, set `type="container"`. With container queries, grid columns and spacing
will be adjusted based on the container width, not the viewport width.

Note that, when using container queries, `cols`, `spacing` and `verticalSpacing` props cannot
reference `theme.breakpoints` values in keys. It is required to use exact px or em values.

To see how the grid changes, resize the root element of the demo
with the resize handle located at the bottom right corner of the demo:

<Demo data={SimpleGridDemos.container} />

## Browser support

`SimpleGrid` uses [CSS Grid Layout](https://caniuse.com/css-grid), it is supported in all modern browsers.
If you need to support older browsers, use [Grid](/core/grid) (flexbox based) component instead.

When `type="container"` is set, `SimpleGrid` uses [container queries](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries).
Since February 2023, container queries are supported in all modern browsers. If you need to support older browsers,
do not use container queries option.
