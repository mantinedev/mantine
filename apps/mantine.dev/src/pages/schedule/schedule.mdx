## Usage

Schedule is a unified component that combines all schedule views (Day, Week, Month, Year) with automatic
view switching. Use the view selector in the header to switch between different views.

<Demo data={ScheduleDemos.usage} />

## Controlled state

Control the current view and date externally using the `view`, `onViewChange`, `date`, and `onDateChange` props.
This allows you to build custom navigation or integrate with other components.

<Demo data={ScheduleDemos.controlled} />

## View-specific props

Customize each view by passing view-specific props via `dayViewProps`, `weekViewProps`, `monthViewProps`,
and `yearViewProps`. These props are forwarded to the corresponding view component.

For example, you can set different time ranges for Day and Week views, or customize the first day of week
for Month and Year views.

## Default view

Set `defaultView` to control which view is shown initially when using uncontrolled mode.

<Demo data={ScheduleDemos.defaultView} />

## Common props

The following props are shared across all views:
- `events` - Events to display
- `locale` - Date formatting locale
- `radius` - Border radius
- `labels` - Label overrides for i18n
- `renderEventBody` - Custom event renderer
- `withDragDrop` - Enable drag and drop
- `onEventDrop` - Drag and drop handler
- `canDragEvent` - Drag permission callback
- `mode` - Interaction mode (`default` or `static`)

These props are automatically passed to all views. For view-specific customization, use the
`dayViewProps`, `weekViewProps`, `monthViewProps`, and `yearViewProps` props.

## Create and update events

Set `withDragSlotSelect` prop to allow users to drag across time slots or day cells to select a range.
When the drag ends, the `onSlotDragEnd` callback is called with the range start and end dates.
Combined with `onTimeSlotClick`, `onAllDaySlotClick`, `onDayClick`, and `onEventClick` callbacks,
this enables a complete event creation and editing experience across all views.

## Responsive styles

Schedule and all its view components use [@container queries](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) for responsive styles.
The components automatically adjust their layout based on the container width, hiding labels
and reducing padding on smaller screens. Container queries are supported in all modern browsers.

## View components

For more control over individual views, use the view components directly:
- [DayView](/schedule/day-view) - Single day with time slots
- [WeekView](/schedule/week-view) - Full week with time slots
- [MonthView](/schedule/month-view) - Calendar month grid
- [YearView](/schedule/year-view) - Full year overview
