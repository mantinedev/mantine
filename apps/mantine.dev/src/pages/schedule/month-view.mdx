## Usage

MonthView displays events in a calendar month grid. It shows event badges in each day cell with support for drag and drop.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.usage} />

## With week numbers

Set `withWeekNumbers` to display week numbers in the first column.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.withWeekNumbers} />

## Without week days

Set `withWeekDays={false}` to hide the weekday names row.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.withoutWeekDays} />

## First day of week

Set `firstDayOfWeek` to control which day starts the week.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.firstDayOfWeek} />

## Weekday format

Use `weekdayFormat` prop to customize weekday names.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.weekdayFormat} />

## Consistent weeks

Set `consistentWeeks={false}` to only show weeks that have days in the current month.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.consistentWeeks} />

## Highlight today

Set `highlightToday={false}` to disable highlighting the current day.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.highlightToday} />

## Without outside days

Set `withOutsideDays={false}` to hide days from adjacent months.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.withoutOutsideDays} />

## Without header

Set `withHeader={false}` to hide the header controls.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.withoutHeader} />

## Many events

When a day has many events, the component shows a "More events" indicator.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.manyEvents} />

## Drag and drop

Enable drag and drop to move events between days.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.dragDrop} />

## Full event customization

Use `renderEvent` prop to fully customize event rendering. This function receives the event
data as the first argument and all props that would be passed to the event root element
(including children) as the second argument, allowing you to wrap events in custom components
like HoverCard, Tooltip, or custom wrappers.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.renderEvent} />

## Static mode

Set `mode="static"` to disable all interactions.

<Demo data={MonthViewDemos.staticMode} />

## Accessibility

### Focus management

In the MonthView component, focus is managed to provide an efficient keyboard navigation experience:

- Only the first day in the month view is included in the tab order (has `tabIndex={0}`)
- All other days have `tabIndex={-1}` and can only be reached via arrow key navigation
- Outside days (days from adjacent months) are navigable using arrow keys when `withOutsideDays` is `true`
- Disabled days are skipped during keyboard navigation

This approach reduces the number of tab stops when navigating through the calendar, making it faster for keyboard users to move through the view while still allowing full access to all days via arrow keys.

### Keyboard interactions

Note that the following events will only trigger if focus is on a day control.

<KeyboardEventsTable
  data={[
    {
      key: 'ArrowRight',
      description: 'Focuses next non-disabled day',
    },
    {
      key: 'ArrowLeft',
      description: 'Focuses previous non-disabled day',
    },
    {
      key: 'ArrowDown',
      description: 'Focuses same day in the next week',
    },
    {
      key: 'ArrowUp',
      description: 'Focuses same day in the previous week',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Day labels

Each day button has an `aria-label` attribute with the full date in the format "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "November 15, 2025"). This provides screen reader users with complete date information.
