## Usage

MobileMonthView is a mobile-optimized calendar view that displays a month grid at the top with event indicators, and a list of events for the selected day at the bottom. This component is designed to work similarly to how calendar applications work on iOS.

The component does not include drag-and-drop functionality and is optimized for touch interactions on mobile devices.

## With week numbers

Set `withWeekNumbers` to display week numbers in the first column.

## With outside days

By default, days from the previous and next months are hidden. Set `withOutsideDays` to display them.

## Static mode

Set `mode="static"` to disable all interactions. In this mode, days are not clickable and no selection changes occur.
