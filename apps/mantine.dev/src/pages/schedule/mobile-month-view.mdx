## Usage

MobileMonthView is a mobile-optimized calendar view that displays a month grid at the top with event indicators, and a list of events for the selected day at the bottom. This component is designed to work similarly to how calendar applications work on iOS.

The component does not include drag-and-drop functionality and is optimized for touch interactions on mobile devices.

## With week numbers

Set `withWeekNumbers` to display week numbers in the first column.

<Demo data={MobileMonthViewDemos.withWeekNumbers} />

## With outside days

By default, days from the previous and next months are hidden. Set `withOutsideDays` to display them.

<Demo data={MobileMonthViewDemos.withOutsideDays} />

## Static mode

Set `mode="static"` to disable all interactions. In this mode, days are not clickable and no selection changes occur.

## Responsive styles

MobileMonthView uses [@container queries](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) for responsive styles.
The component automatically adjusts its layout based on the container width, hiding labels
and reducing padding on smaller screens. Container queries are supported in all modern browsers.

## Accessibility

MobileMonthView follows the same keyboard navigation patterns as [MonthView](./month-view.mdx#accessibility).

### Focus management

The first day of the month is included in the tab order (`tabIndex={0}`), while all other days have `tabIndex={-1}`. When a day receives focus via arrow key navigation, the component updates `tabIndex` values so that the newly focused day becomes the tab stop.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardEventsTable
  data={[
    {
      key: 'ArrowRight',
      description: 'Focuses next non-disabled day',
    },
    {
      key: 'ArrowLeft',
      description: 'Focuses previous non-disabled day',
    },
    {
      key: 'ArrowDown',
      description: 'Focuses same day in the next week',
    },
    {
      key: 'ArrowUp',
      description: 'Focuses same day in the previous week',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Day labels

Each day button has an `aria-label` attribute with the full date in the format "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "November 15, 2025"). This provides screen reader users with complete date information.
