    body: "<p>Man, I've been doing Front-End for 20 years. This is, hands-down, the best component library I've ever used. What's more, the parts that I didn't like (Styling from JS Objects, slow with big forms) have been addressed in v7. Please keep it up, this library deserves more exposure, it just works and works well and beautifully. Many thanks to <a href='https://github.com/rtivital' target='_blank'>@rtivital</a> and the contributors!</p>",

    body: "<p>Hope this kind of post is ok - just wanted to say thank you.</p><p>I've been writing software professionally for 25 years, with the last 15 in web (mostly internal projects in my company). This is easily the best component library I've ever used.</p><p>In every other instance I've run into the boundaries of what the library does and have to spend a lot of time and energy customizing or extending it. Not only does Mantine provide easy access to everything under the hood, but 99% the things you need are provided as default options. I've started to lose count of the \"guess I'd better build my standard xyz... oh wait, they have that too\" moments. Also the docs are perfect.</p><p>Bravo, thank you.</p>",
