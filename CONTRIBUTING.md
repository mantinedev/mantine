## Contributing workflow

- After deciding which [GitHub issue](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/labels/help%20wanted) or feature you'd like to work on, create a local branch to track your changes
- If applicable, add unit tests while implementing your code
- Ensure that all commits follow our [commit convention](#commit-convention)
- It is highly recommended that you run the `npm test` command to ensure new contributions integrate with the old before initiating a merge request
- Create a merge request and keep up-to-date with any feedback you receive from a maintainer

If you are unable to finish your task, please let us know in the GitHub Issue in which your work was initiated. The Mantine community is friendly; we won't judge or ask any questions if you decide to cancel your submission.

## Commit convention

Mantine is a monorepo, so it is important to write the correct commit messages to keep the git history clean. All commits made in this repository are divided into 3 groups:

- **package commits** - related to a particular package
- **docs commits** - related to documentation
- **core commits** - only related to repository tooling (**not** associated with any package)

The commit message consists of 3 parts:

```bash
[area] Optional title: Message
```

Examples:

- `[core] Fix documentation deployment script` – Change made in repository script, it is not related to documentation or any package
- `[docs] Update report issues link` – Change related to documentation website
- `[@mantine/core] Button: Add theme focus styles` – Change in `@mantine/core` package at Button component
- `[@mantine/hooks] use-list-state: Add remove handler` – Change in `@mantine/hooks` package at use-list-state hook

## Git branches

- **master**: the current version, or alternatively, patches for current _minor_ version (1.0.x)
- **dev**: contains the next minor version (1.x.0) (more often than not, you'll want to create a PR directly to this branch)
