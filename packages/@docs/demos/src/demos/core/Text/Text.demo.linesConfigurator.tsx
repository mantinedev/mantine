        From Bulbapedia: Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pok√©mon that has blue-green skin with
        darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of
        its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are
        visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three
        sharp claws. On Bulbasaur&apos;s back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
        planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines and provides
        it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained
        within.
