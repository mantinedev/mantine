    <Text>
      We Butter the Bread with Butter was founded in 2007 by Marcel Neumann, who was originally
      guitarist for Martin Kesici&apos;s band, and Tobias Schultka. The band was originally meant as
      a joke, but progressed into being a more serious musical duo. The name for the band has no
      particular meaning, although its origins were suggested from when the two original members
      were driving in a car operated by Marcel Neumann and an accident almost occurred. Neumann
      found Schultka &quot;so funny that he briefly lost control of the vehicle.&quot; Many of their
      songs from this point were covers of German folk tales and nursery rhymes.
