## Usage

`DatesProvider` component lets you set various settings that are shared across all
components exported from `@mantine/dates` package. `DatesProvider` supports the following settings:

- `locale` – dayjs locale, note that you also need to import corresponding locale module from dayjs. Default value is `en`.
- `firstDayOfWeek` – number from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. Default value is 1 – Monday.
- `weekendDays` – an array of numbers from 0 to 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. Default value is `[0, 6]` – Saturday and Sunday.
- `timezone` – a textual representation of a time zone, for example, `UTC`.

## Timezone

When working with the `DatesProvider`, parsing the `timezone` parameter offers a valuable feature for controlling how
dates and times are displayed within your application. By specifying a timezone of your choice, you can ensure
that date information is presented in the desired timezone, rather than relying on the user's browser settings.
If you don't provide a `timezone` parameter or explicitly set it to `undefined`, the application will default to using
the user's browser timezone.

The `timezone` parameter sets the timezone context for all components integrated within the `DatesProvider`. This means
that all date and time-related data displayed within your application will adhere to the specified timezone. This simplifies
the process of maintaining consistency in how dates and times are presented to users across various parts of your application.

## Accessing the timezone information

If you need to access the current timezone information from other parts of your application, you can leverage the
`getTimezone()` function provided by the `useDatesContext()` hook. This function allows you to retrieve the active
timezone setting and use it as needed.

## Date format considerations

It's important to note that the `DatesProvider` system supports the provision of dates in the user's local timezone.
However, many backend systems and data sources use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) timestamps. In such cases, you can
easily convert and parse UTC timestamps into the user's timezone using JavaScript, as demonstrated by
the example: `new Date('2000-10-03 02:10:00Z')`.

By effectively utilizing the `timezone` parameter and the provided functions, you can tailor the presentation of date
and time data to meet the specific requirements of your application while maintaining compatibility with various data sources.
