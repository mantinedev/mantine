## Usage

FocusTrap is a component implementation of [use-focus-trap](/hooks/use-focus-trap/) hook,
it is used in all Mantine components that require focus trap ([Modal](/core/modal/), [DatePicker](/dates/date-picker/), [Popover](/core/popover/), etc.).

## Initial focus

To define the element that will receive initial focus set `data-autofocus` attribute:

<Demo data={FocusTrapDemos.initial} />

## Focus trapping logic

- Focus is trapped within child node if `active` prop is `true`
- When FocusTrap component is mounted or when `active` prop changes from `false` to `true` first element with `data-autofocus` attribute is focused
- If there are no elements with `data-autofocus` attribute, then the first element that supports keyboard interaction is focused
- If the target element does not have focusable elements or does not support `ref`, then the focus trap will not work
- Trap stops working when element outside of the `FocusTrap` child is focused
