import { Layout } from '@/layout';
import { MDX_DATA } from '@/mdx';
import { DialogDemos } from '@docs/demos';

export default Layout(MDX_DATA.Dialog);

## Usage

`Dialog` is a simplified version of [Modal](/core/modal/) component.
It does not include most of accessibility and usability [Modal](/core/modal/) features:

- Focus trap is not available
- Does not close on click outside
- Does not have overlay

Use `Dialog` to attract attention with not important information or action,
for example, you can create an email subscription form:

<Demo data={DialogDemos.usage} />

## Change position

`Dialog` is rendered in [Portal](/core/portal/) and has fixed position, set `position` prop to control dialog's position:

```tsx
// Dialog in top left corner
<Dialog position={{ top: 20, left: 20 }} />

// Dialog in bottom left corner
<Dialog position={{ bottom: 20, left: 20 }} />
```

## Accessibility

`Dialog` is not accessible and most likely will not be announced by screen reader,
make sure you do not put any important information. In most cases it would be better
to select [Modal](/core/modal/), [Drawer](/core/drawer/) or [Notifications](/others/notifications/).
