## Usage

<Demo data={CompositeDemos.basicList} />

### Focus behavior

`Composite` component applies different focus movement and selection strategies based on the layout ([Keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation)).
Currently, it provides focus behaviors for vertical lists, horizontal lists, and layout grids.

## Options

<Demo data={CompositeDemos.imageGrid} />

## Selection state

<Demo data={CompositeDemos.controlledComposite} />

### Defining custom keys

By default, `Composite` uses `id` or `key` property of items as their unique identifier.
If your items do not contain any of these properties, you can use `getItemKey` property to define a custom key.

```tsx
<Composite
  ...
  getItemKey={(item) => item.slug}
/>
```

## Disabled items

You can disable items in a `Composite` component by setting the `disabledKeys` option.
Disabled options can not be selected and the focus movement skips these items.

Additionaly, `aria-disabled` HTML attribute is set to `true` for these items, which can be used for custom styling.

```scss
.listItem {
  &[aria-disabled='true'] {
    @mixin light {
      background: var(--mantine-color-gray-2);
    }
    @mixin dark {
      background: var(--mantine-color-dark-7);
    }
  }
  &[aria-disabled='true'] * {
    text-decoration: none;
    @mixin light {
      color: var(--mantine-color-gray-6);
    }
    @mixin dark {
      color: var(--mantine-color-gray-7);
    }
  }
}
```

## Composite context

`CompositeContext` provides two boolean values `multiple` and `selectionMode` to identify the selection type and
whether the component in the selection mode. `selectionMode` changes only if `selectionOptions.trackSelectioMode` is set to true.

The following example shows how items can change based on these values.
If nothing is selected (`selectionMode: false`), an overlay and checkbox is shown only if an item is hovered.
After an item is selected (`selectionMode: true`), all items render their overlays.

```tsx
const ctx = useCompositeContext();
...
<Overlay display={ctx.selectionMode ? 'block' : undefined}>
  <Checkbox
    tabIndex={-1}
    checked={selected}
    disabled={disabled}
    readOnly
    aria-hidden
    size="md"
    radius={ctx.multiple ? 'sm' : 'lg'}
  />
</Overlay>
...
```

<Demo data={CompositeDemos.cardGrid} />

## Keyboard navigation

### Vertical/Horizontal List

**Focus:**

- `Down Arrow` / `Right Arrow`: Moves focus to the next option.
  - If focus is on the last item and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the first item.
- `Up Arrow` / `Left Arrow`: Moves focus to the previous option.
  - If focus is on the first item and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the last item.
- `Page Down`: Moves focus down `focusOptions.pageSize` number of items. If focus is in the last item of the list, focus does not move.
- `Page Up`: Moves focus up `focusOptions.pageSize` number of items. If focus is in the first item of the list, focus does not move.
- `Home`: Moves focus to first option.
- `End`: Moves focus to last option.

**Selection:**

- `Space`: changes the selection state of the focused option.
- `Control + A`: Selects all options in the list. If all options are selected, it unselect all options.

  > In a single-select list, selection also move with focus when `selectionOptions.followFocus` options is set `true`.

  > In a multi-select list, focus movements with `Shift` modifier, selects contiguous items from the most recently selected item to the focused item.
  > For example, `Shift + Home` selects the focused option and all options up to the first option, and moves focus to the first option.

### Layout Grid

**Focus:**

- `Right Arrow`: Moves focus one cell to the right.
  - If focus is on the right-most cell in the row and
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextRow: true`, focus moves to the first cell in the following row.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextRow: false` and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the first cell in the same row.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextRow: false` and `focusOptions.loop: false`, focus does not move.
  - If focus is on the last cell in the grid and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the first cell in the grid; otherwise, focus does not move.
- `Left Arrow`: Moves focus one cell to the left.
  - If focus is on the left-most cell in the row and
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextRow: true`, focus moves to the last cell in the previous row.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextRow: false` and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the first cell in the same row.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextRow: false` and `focusOptions.loop: false`, focus does not move.
  - If focus is on the first cell in the grid and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the last cell in the grid; otherwise, focus does not move.
- `Down Arrow`: Moves focus one cell down.
  - If focus is on the bottom cell in the column and
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextColumn: true`, focus moves to the top cell in the following column.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextColumn: false` and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the top cell in the same column.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextColumn: false` and `focusOptions.loop: false`, focus does not move.
  - If focus is on the bottom cell in the last column and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the first cell in the grid; otherwise, focus does not move.
- `Up Arrow`: Moves focus one cell up.
  - If focus is on the top cell in the column and
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextColumn: true`, focus moves to the bottom cell in the previous column.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextColumn: false` and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the bottom cell in the same column.
    - `focusOptions.moveToNextColumn: false` and `focusOptions.loop: false`, focus does not move.
  - If focus is on the first cell in the grid and `focusOptions.loop: true`, focus moves to the bottom cell in the last column; otherwise, focus does not move.
- `Page Down`: Moves focus down `focusOptions.pageSize` number of rows. If focus is in the last row of the grid, focus does not move.
- `Page Up`: Moves focus up `focusOptions.pageSize` number of rows. If focus is in the first row of the grid, focus does not move.
- `Home`: moves focus to the first cell in the row that contains focus.
- `End`: moves focus to the last cell in the row that contains focus.
- `Control + Home`: moves focus to the first cell in the first row.
- `Control + End`: moves focus to the last cell in the last row.

**Selection:**

- `Space`: Changes the selection state of the focused option.
- `Control + A`: Selects all options in the list. If all options are selected, it unselect all options.

  > In a single-select grid, selection also move with focus when `selectionOptions.followFocus` options is set `true`.

  > In a multi-select grid, focus movements with `Shift` modifier, selects contiguous items from the most recently selected item to the focused item.
  > For example, `Control + Shift + Home` selects the focused option and all options up to the first option in the grid, and moves focus to the first option.
