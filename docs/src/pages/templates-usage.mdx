# Templates

Mantine provides a set of templates for most common use cases.
A template is a set of configuration files that are required to
get started with Mantine and a React framework of your choice.
You can find a list of all available templates on the [getting started page](/getting-started).

## Getting started with a template

To get started with one of the templates:

- Open it on GitHub
- Click "Use this template" button
- Click "Create a new repository" in the dropdown
- Enter repository name and click "Create repository from template"
- Clone your new repository
- Install dependencies by running `yarn`
- Start development server by running `yarn dev`/`yarn start` (exact command depends on the framework of the template)

## Without GitHub account

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can download a template as a zip archive:

- Open template on GitHub
- Click "Code" button (it is next to the "Use this template" button)
- Click "Download ZIP"
- Extract downloaded archive
- Install dependencies by running `yarn`
- Start development server by running `yarn dev`/`yarn start` (exact command depends on the framework of the template)
