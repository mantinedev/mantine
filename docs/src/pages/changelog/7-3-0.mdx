## smaller-than and larger-than mixins

`smaller-than` and `larger-than` mixins can be used to create styles that will be applied only when the screen is smaller or larger than specified breakpoint.
Note that to use these mixins, you need to update [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset) to version `1.11.0` or higher.

```scss
.demo {
  @mixin smaller-than 320px {
    color: red;
  }

  @mixin larger-than 320px {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

Will be transformed to:

```scss
// Breakpoint values are converted to em units
// In smaller-than mixin 0.1px is subtracted from breakpoint value
// to avoid intersection with larger-than mixin
@media (max-width: 19.99375em) {
  .demo {
    color: red;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 20em) {
  .demo {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

You can also use `smaller-than` and `larger-than` mixins with [mantine breakpoints](/styles/responsive/#breakpoints-variables-in-css-modules):

```scss
.demo {
  @mixin smaller-than $mantine-breakpoint-sm {
    color: red;
  }

  @mixin larger-than $mantine-breakpoint-sm {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

## Form schema resolvers packages

`@mantine/form` schema validation resolver packages are now available as [separate packages](/form/schema-validation).
Moving resolvers to separate packages allows making them type-safe and fully tested.
Old resolvers are still exported from `@mantine/form` package – you will be able to use them without any changes
until 8.0.0 release.

The new packages are drop-in replacements for old resolvers, they have the same API and can be used in the same way.

Example of zod resolver:

<InstallScript packages="zod mantine-form-zod-resolver" />

```tsx
import { z } from 'zod';
import { useForm } from '@mantine/form';
import { zodResolver } from 'mantine-form-zod-resolver';

const schema = z.object({
  name: z
    .string()
    .min(2, { message: 'Name should have at least 2 letters' }),
  email: z.string().email({ message: 'Invalid email' }),
  age: z.number().min(18, {
    message: 'You must be at least 18 to create an account',
  }),
});

const form = useForm({
  initialValues: {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    age: 16,
  },
  validate: zodResolver(schema),
});

form.validate();
form.errors;
// -> {
//  name: 'Name should have at least 2 letters',
//  email: 'Invalid email',
//  age: 'You must be at least 18 to create an account'
// }
```

## rem/em functions improvements

[rem and em](/styles/rem) function now support space-separated values. This feature is available
both in `rem` function exported from `@mantine/core` package and [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset).
Note that you need to update [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset) to `1.11.0` to use this feature.

```tsx
import { rem } from '@mantine/core';

rem('16px 32px');
// -> calc(1rem * var(--mantine-scale)) calc(2rem * var(--mantine-scale))
```

All components props that are converted to `rem` units now support space-separated values as well.
For example, space-separated values can be used in `radius` prop of [Modal](/core/modal) component:

```tsx
import { Modal } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return <Modal radius="10px 10px 0 0" opened onClose={() => {}} />;
}
```

## component and renderRoot props for non-polymorphic components

All Mantine components now support `component` and `renderRoot` props event if they are not [polymorphic](/guides/polymorphic).
The difference between polymorphic and non-polymorphic components is that polymorphic components
include the full set of props of the component passed to the `component` prop, while non-polymorphic
components only include props that are specific to the original component. It is done this way to
improve TypeScript performance.

```tsx
import { Group } from '@mantine/core';

// Group is not polymorphic component,
// but it still supports component and renderRoot props
function Demo() {
  return (
    <Group component="nav">
      <a>Item 1</a>
      <a>Item 2</a>
      <a>Item 3</a>
    </Group>
  );
}
```

## Outline Checkbox and Radio variant

[Checkbox](/core/checkbox) and [Radio](/core/radio) components now support `outline` variant:

<Demo data={Changelog730Demos.checkboxRadioVariant} />

## HueSlider and AlphaSlider components

[HueSlider and AlphaSlider](/core/color-picker) components were added back:

<Demo data={ColorPickerDemos.hueSlider} />

<br />

<Demo data={ColorPickerDemos.alphaSlider} />

## Button loading state animation

[Button](/core/button) component now has loading state animation:

<Demo data={ButtonDemos.loading} />

## Drawer offset

[Drawer](/core/drawer) now supports `offset` prop. It changes drawer offset from the edge of the viewport:

<Demo data={DrawerDemos.offset} />

## z-index CSS variables

You can now use Mantine z-index CSS variables:

- `--mantine-z-index-app` – value `100`
- `--mantine-z-index-modal` – value `200`
- `--mantine-z-index-popover` – value `300`
- `--mantine-z-index-overlay` – value `400`
- `--mantine-z-index-max` – value `9999`

Example of using `--mantine-z-index-modal` variable:

```css
/* Display content above the modal */
.my-content {
  z-index: calc(var(--mantine-z-index-modal) + 1);
}
```

## Improved dark color scheme colors

`theme.colors.dark` colors were slightly changed to improve contrast and make it easier to read text.
You can preview new colors on [this page](/theming/colors/#default-colors). New colors values are:

```scss
--mantine-color-dark-0: #c9c9c9;
--mantine-color-dark-1: #b8b8b8;
--mantine-color-dark-2: #828282;
--mantine-color-dark-3: #696969;
--mantine-color-dark-4: #4a4a4a;
--mantine-color-dark-5: #404040;
--mantine-color-dark-6: #383838;
--mantine-color-dark-7: #2e2e2e;
--mantine-color-dark-8: #242424;
--mantine-color-dark-9: #212121;
```

If you prefer old colors, change theme settings on `MantineProvider`:

```tsx
import { createTheme } from '@mantine/core';

const theme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    dark: [
      '#C1C2C5',
      '#A6A7AB',
      '#909296',
      '#5c5f66',
      '#373A40',
      '#2C2E33',
      '#25262b',
      '#1A1B1E',
      '#141517',
      '#101113',
    ],
  },
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your app here */}
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```
