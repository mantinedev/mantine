## Contributing workflow

- Decide on what you want to contribute.
- If you would like to implement a new feature, discuss it with the maintainer ([GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/discussions/new) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/wbH82zuWMN)) before jumping into coding.
- After finalizing issue details, as you begin working on the code, please make sure to follow commit conventions.
- Run tests with `npm test` and submit a PR once all tests have passed.
- Get a code review and fix all issues noticed by the maintainer.
- If you cannot finish your task or if you change your mind – that's totally fine! Just let us know in the GitHub issue that you created during the first step of this process. The Mantine community is friendly – we won't judge or ask any questions if you decide to cancel your submission.
- Your PR is merged. You are awesome ❤️!
