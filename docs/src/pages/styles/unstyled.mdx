# Unstyled components

## Using Mantine as a headless UI library

You can use Mantine as a headless UI library. To do that, simply do not import `@mantine/*/styles.css`
in your application. Then you will be able to apply styles to Mantine components using [Styles API](/styles/styles-api/)
with a styling solution of your choice.

## unstyled prop

Most of Mantine components support `unstyled` prop that removes library styles from the component and allows you to style it
from scratch. Note that `unstyled` prop is not supported by compound components (`Tabs.Tab`, `Menu.Dropdown`, `Accordion.Control`, etc.)
– it only works on root component (`Tabs`, `Menu`, `Accordion`, etc.).

Unstyled [Tabs](/core/tabs) component:

<Demo data={StylesDemos.unstyled} />

> **Choosing between unstyled prop and headless components**
>
> `unstyled` prop is useful when you want to remove library styles from a single component,
> but keep styles for other components. For example, if [Tabs](/core/tabs) component does
> not meet your design system requirements, but all other components do, you can use `unstyled`
> prop to remove styles from Tabs and style it from scratch, while keeping all other components
> styled with Mantine styles.
>
> Note that `unstyled` prop does not remove Mantine library styles from your `.css` bundle –
> it only does not apply them to component with `unstyled` prop.
