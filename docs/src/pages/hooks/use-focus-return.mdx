export default Layout(MDX_DATA.useFocusReturn);

## Usage

`use-focus-return` automatically returns focus to the last focused element when a given condition is met.
For example, it is used in [Modal](/core/modal/) component to restore focus after the modal was closed.

Close the modal with the `Escape` key and see how focus returns to the button after the modal closes:

<Demo data={ModalDemos.usage} demoProps={{ toggle: true }} />

In most cases, you should use this hook with [use-focus-trap](/hooks/use-focus-trap/).

```tsx
useFocusReturn({
  // Is region with focus trap active?
  // When it activates hook saves document.activeElement to the internal state
  // and focuses this element once focus trap is deactivated
  opened: false,

  // Determines whether focus should be returned automatically, true by default
  shouldReturnFocus: true,
});
```

If `shouldReturnFocus` option is set to `false` you can call returned function to focus last active element:

```tsx
const returnFocus = useFocusReturn({
  opened: false,
  shouldReturnFocus: false,
});

// ... later
returnFocus();
```

## Definition

```tsx
function useFocusReturn(options: {
  opened: boolean;
  shouldReturnFocus?: boolean;
}): () => void;
```
