export default Layout(MDX_DATA.useDebouncedValue);

## Usage

`use-debounced-value` hook debounces value changes.
This can be useful in case you want to perform a heavy operation based on react state,
for example, send search request. Unlike [use-debounced-state](/hooks/use-debounced-state/) it
is designed to work with controlled components.

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useDebouncedValueUsage} />

## Differences from use-debounced-state

- You have direct access to the non-debounced value.
- It is used for controlled inputs (`value` prop instead of `defaultValue`), e.g. renders on every state change like a character typed in an input.
- It works with props or other state providers, and it does not force use of `useState`.

## Leading update

You can immediately update value with first call with `{ leading: true }` options:

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useDebouncedValueLeading} />

## Cancel update

Hook provides `cancel` callback, you can use it to cancel update.
Update cancels automatically on component unmount.

In this example, type in some text and click the cancel button
within a second to cancel debounced value change:

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useDebouncedValueCancel} />

## Definition

```tsx
function useDebouncedValue<T = any>(
  value: T,
  wait: number,
  options?: {
    leading: boolean;
  }
): readonly [T, () => void];
```
