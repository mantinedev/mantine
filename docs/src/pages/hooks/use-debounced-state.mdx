export default Layout(MDX_DATA.useDebouncedState);

## Usage

`use-debounced-state` hook debounces value changes.
This can be useful in case you want to perform a heavy operation based on react state,
for example, send search request. Unlike [use-debounced-value](/hooks/use-debounced-value/) it
is designed to work with uncontrolled components.

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useDebouncedStateUsage} />

## Differences from use-debounce-value

- You do not have direct access to the non-debounced value.
- It is used for uncontrolled inputs (`defaultValue` prop instead of `value`), e.g. does not render with every state change like a character typed in an input.
- It does not work with custom state providers or props, and it uses `useState` internally.

## Leading update

You can immediately update value with first call with `{ leading: true }` options:

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useDebouncedStateLeading} />

## Definition

```tsx
function useDebouncedState<T = any>(
  defaultValue: T,
  wait: number,
  options?: {
    leading: boolean;
  }
): readonly [T, (newValue: T) => void];
```
