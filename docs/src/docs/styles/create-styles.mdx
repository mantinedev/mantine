# createStyles

All Mantine components are built with [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) based css-in-js library.
We recommend using `createStyles` to create styles for the rest of your application
as it provides the most convenient way to utilize Mantine theme, but it is not required
â€“ you can use any other styling tools and languages.

## Usage

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesBasics} />

## Pseudo-classes

You can add pseudo-classes the same way as in any css-preprocessor like Sass:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesPseudo} />

## Styles parameters

You can receive any amount of parameters as second argument of `createStyles` function,
latter you will need to pass those parameters as argument to `useStyles` hook:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesParameters} />

## Composition and nested selectors

Since `createStyles` produces scoped class names you will need to create a reference to selector
in order to get static selector. Use `getStylesRef` function to assign static selectors:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesComposition} />

## Classes merging (cx function)

To merge class names use `cx` function, it has the same api as [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) package.

**!important:** Do not use external libraries like [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)
or [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) with class names created with `createStyles` function
as it will produce styles collisions.

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesCx} />

## Media queries

You can use nested media queries like in Sass. Within query body you can use `theme.breakpoints`
defined with [MantineProvider](/theming/mantine-provider) or just static values:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesMedia} />

## Keyframes

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesKeyframes} />
