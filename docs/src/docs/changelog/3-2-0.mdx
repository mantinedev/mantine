import { DatePickerDemos } from '@demos/dates';

## Breaking changes

- [Group](https://mantine.dev/core/group/) component was migrated to [flexbox gap](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap), it no longer uses hack with negative margins, thus `withGutter` prop is not longer supported.
- [Button](https://mantine.dev/core/button/) component no longer supports `link` variant due to Styles API limitations, use [Anchor](https://mantine.dev/core/anchor/) component instead.
- `@mantine/core` package no longer exports `getFontStyles`, `getFocusStyles` and `hexToRgba` functions, replace them with [theme functions](https://mantine.dev/theming/functions/): `theme.fn.fontStyles()`, `theme.fn.focusStyles()`, `theme.fn.rgba()`.

## New features

[DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) component now supports free input:

<Demo data={DatePickerDemos.freeInput} />

## Other changes

- All date picking components from @mantine/dates package now support first day of week customization (either sunday or monday)
- [Tabs](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/) component pills variant was redesigned to be more neutral
- [SegmentedControl](https://mantine.dev/core/segmented-control/) component is now a generic – it accepts values as single type argument
- [Autocomplete](https://mantine.dev/core/autocomplete/), [Select](https://mantine.dev/core/select/) and [MultiSelect](https://mantine.dev/core/multi-select/) dropdowns are now rendered within [Popper](https://mantine.dev/core/popper/). This means that dropdown element is now aware of its position on screen and will change placement based on container scroll position. You should also experience less issues with z-index configuration.
