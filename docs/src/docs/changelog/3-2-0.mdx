import { DatePickerDemos } from '@demos/dates';

## Breaking changes

- [Group](https://mantine.dev/core/group/) component was migrated to [flexbox gap](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap), it no longer uses hack with negative margins, thus `withGutter` prop is not longer supported.
- [Button](https://mantine.dev/core/button/) component no longer supports `link` variant due to Styles API limitations, use [Anchor](https://mantine.dev/core/anchor/) component instead.
- `@mantine/core` package no longer exports `getFontStyles`, `getFocusStyles` and `hexToRgba` functions, replace them with [theme functions](https://mantine.dev/theming/functions/): `theme.fn.fontStyles()`, `theme.fn.focusStyles()`, `theme.fn.rgba()`.

## Functions on theme

Mantine theme now adds several functions ([full list](https://mantine.dev/theming/functions/)) that can help you
write styles in `createStyles` function, `styles` and `sx` props:

```tsx
import { createStyles } from '@mantine/core';

const useStyles = createStyles((theme) => ({
  myResponsiveText: {
    fontSize: theme.fontSizes.md,

    [theme.fn.smallerThan('sm')]: {
      fontSize: theme.fontSizes.sm,
    },

    [theme.fn.smallerThan(500)]: {
      fontSize: theme.fontSizes.xs,
    },
  },
}));

function MyResponsiveText() {
  const { classes } = useStyles();
  return <div className={classes.myResponsiveText}>My responsive text</div>;
}
```

## Custom properties on theme

You can now add any amount of custom properties on Mantine theme using `other` key:

```tsx
// Add any other properties on theme
<MantineProvider
  theme={{
    other: {
      fontFamilySecondary: 'Arial',
      lineHeights: [1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 1.95],
      reduceMotion: true,
    },
  }}
>
  <App />
</MantineProvider>

// Then use your custom properties
<Box sx={(theme) => ({
  fontFamily: theme.other.fontFamilySecondary,
  lineHeight: theme.other.lineHeight[2],
  transitionDuration: theme.other.reduceMotion ? '0ms' : '200ms',
})} />
```

## New features

[DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) component now supports free input:

<Demo data={DatePickerDemos.freeInput} />

## Other changes

- Two new guides were added: [RTL Support](https://mantine.dev/theming/rtl/) and [Responsive styles](https://mantine.dev/theming/responsive/)
- All date picking components from @mantine/dates package now support first day of week customization (either sunday or monday)
- [Tabs](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/) component pills variant was redesigned to be more neutral
- [SegmentedControl](https://mantine.dev/core/segmented-control/) component is now a generic – it accepts values as single type argument
- [Autocomplete](https://mantine.dev/core/autocomplete/), [Select](https://mantine.dev/core/select/) and [MultiSelect](https://mantine.dev/core/multi-select/) dropdowns are now rendered within [Popper](https://mantine.dev/core/popper/). This means that dropdown element is now aware of its position on screen and will change placement based on container scroll position. You should also experience less issues with z-index configuration.
- [Col](https://mantine.dev/core/grid/) component now supports responsive offset props: `offsetXs={5}`, `offsetMd={10}`, etc.
