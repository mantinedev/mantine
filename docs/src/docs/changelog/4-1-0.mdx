## @mantine/notifications improvements

[Notifications system](https://mantine.dev/others/notifications/) functions were migrated to
[custom events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events),
they are no longer depend on context and can be called in any part of application.
Old way with `useNotifications` hook will work until version 5.0 release.

`@mantine/notifications` now exports the following functions:

- `showNotification` – adds given notification to notifications list or queue depending on current state and limit
- `updateNotification` – updates notification that was previously added to the state or queue
- `hideNotification` – removes notification with given id from notifications state and queue
- `cleanNotifications` – removes all notifications from notifications state and queue
- `cleanNotificationsQueue` – removes all notifications from queue
