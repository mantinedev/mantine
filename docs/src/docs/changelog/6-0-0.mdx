## Breaking changes

The following changes are breaking. Note that although
we've tried to include all breaking changes with migration guides in the list you still may
experience undocumented changes. If you think that these changes worth including in this list,
let us know by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/new/choose).

### Migration to rem/em units

All Mantine components now use [rem units](https://mantine.dev/styles/rem/). `1rem` is considered to be `16px`
with medium text size selected by user, all components will scale based on settings specified in browser.
`theme.spacing`, `theme.radius`, `theme.fontSizes` and other theme properties overrides
are now expected to be defined in rem. `theme.breakpoints` are expected to be defined in `em` units:

```tsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider
      theme={{
        spacing: { xs: '1rem', sm: '1.5rem' /* ... */ },
        fontSizes: { xs: '0.8rem', sm: '1.2rem' /* ... */ },
        radius: { xs: '0.1rem', sm: '0.3rem' /* ... */ },
        breakpoints: { xs: '20em', sm: '36em' /* ... */ },
      }}
    >
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

You can no longer use addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and other math operations
with theme values in [createStyles](https://mantine.dev/styles/create-styles/) and [sx prop](https://mantine.dev/styles/sx/),
use `calc` instead:

```tsx
import { createStyles, rem } from '@mantine/core':

// 5.x expressions that will no longer work in 6.x
createStyles((theme) => ({
  demo: {
    // Values cannot longer be prepended with minus sign
    margin: -theme.spacing.xs,

    // addition, subtraction, division, multiplication
    // and other math operations are no longer available
    paddingLeft: theme.spacing.md + 5,
    paddingRight: theme.spacing.sm / 2,
    paddingTop: theme.spacing.lg * 1.5,
    paddingBottom: theme.spacing.xl - theme.spacing.md,

    // theme values used in sting templates
    // will no longer work with px suffix
    margin: `${theme.spacing.xs}px ${theme.spacing.md}px`
  }
}));

// In 6.0 use calc
createStyles((theme) => ({
  demo: {
    // Use calc to negate theme value
    margin: `calc(${theme.spacing.xs} * -1)`,

    // Use calc and rem function for
    // addition, subtraction, division, multiplication
    paddingLeft: `calc(${theme.spacing.md} + ${rem(5)})`,
    paddingRight: `calc(${theme.spacing.sm} / 2)`,
    paddingTop: `calc(${theme.spacing.lg} * 1.5)`,
    paddingBottom: `calc(${theme.spacing.xl} - ${theme.spacing.md})`,

    // Omit px suffix when using theme values
    margin: `${theme.spacing.xs} ${theme.spacing.md}`
  }
}));
```

### Automatic px to rem conversion

If you use numbers in Mantine components props, they will be treated as `px` and converted to `rem`,
for example:

```tsx
import { ColorSwatch } from '@mantine/core';

function DemoPx() {
  // Specify ColorSwatch size in px, it will be automatically converted to rem
  // Width and height of ColorSwatch in this case will be 32px / 16 = 2rem
  return <ColorSwatch color="#000" size={32} />;
}

function DemoRem() {
  // This demo will have the same size as previous one
  return <ColorSwatch color="#000" size="2rem" />;
}
```

The same logic is applied to [style props](/styles/style-props/) available
in every component:

```tsx
import { Box } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  // width: 2rem, height: 1rem
  // margin-left: 1rem
  // @media (min-width: theme.breakpoints.sm) -> margin-left: 2rem
  return <Box w={32} h={16} ml={{ base: 16, sm: 32 }} />;
}
```

### createStyles breaking changes

[createStyles](https://mantine.dev/styles/create-styles/) function no longer receives `getRef`
as a third argument. Use `getStylesRef` exported from `@mantine/core` package instead:

```tsx
// in 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { createStyles } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params, getRef) => {
  child: { ref: getRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});

// in 6.x use getStylesRef function
import { createStyles, getStylesRef } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params) => {
  child: { ref: getStylesRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getStylesRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});
```

### @mantine/notifications breaking changes

[@mantine/notifications](https://mantine.dev/others/notifications/) package no longer exports
`NotificationsProvider` component. Instead you should add `Notifications` component to any
part of your application. This change allows to avoid unnecessary rerenders of child components
when notifications state change. Also `useNotifications` hook is no longer exported from the package.

```tsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { Notifications } from '@mantine/notifications';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withNormalizeCSS withGlobalStyles>
      <Notifications />
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

### @mantine/rte package deprecation

`@mantine/rte` package is deprecated – it will no longer receive updates (last version will remain 5.x)
and it may no longer be compatible with `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks` packages (6.x and later versions).
Migrate to [@mantine/tiptap](https://mantine.dev/others/tiptap/) as soon as possible.

### @mantine/dates breaking changes

All components from `@mantine/dates` package were rebuilt from scratch.
Note that the following list is not full as it is difficult to include all breaking changes
after a full package revamp – follow documentation of component that you use to find out about
all breaking changes.

- Styles API selectors of components were changed
- `DatePicker` component was renamed to `DatePickerInput`
- `Calendar` component was renamed to `DatePicker`
- `TimeInput` component was migrated to native `input[type="time"]` as it provides better UX in most browsers
- `TimeRangeInput` component was removed – it is no longer exported from the package
- `DateRangePicker` and `RangeCalendar` components were removed – you can now setup dates range picking in [DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) and [DatePickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker-input/)
- `amountOfMonths` prop was renamed to `numberOfColumns` in all components
- `DatePickerInput` (previously `DatePicker`) component no longer supports `allowFreeInput` prop – use [DateInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-input/) component instead
- `DatePicker` (previously `Calendar`) component no longer supports `dayClassName` and `dayStyle` props – use `getDayProps` instead

### Theme object changes

You can no longer define `dateFormat` and `datesLocale` in [theme](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/),
use components prop to specify format instead:

```tsx
// 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={{ dateFormat: 'MMMM DD YYYY', datesLocale: 'es' }}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}

// 6.x – use components props
import { DatePickerInput } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  return <DatePickerInput valueFormat="MMMM D, YYYY" locale="es" />;
}
```

### Modal and Drawer breaking changes

[Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) and [Drawer](https://mantine.dev/core/drawer/) components
props were renamed:

- `withFocusReturn` → `returnFocus`
- `overflow` → `scrollAreaComponent` (scroll now is always handled inside modal/drawer)
- `overlayBlur` → `overlayProps.blur`
- `overlayColor` → `overlayProps.color`
- `overlayOpacity` → `overlayProps.opacity`
- `exitTransitionDuration` → `transitionProps.exitDuration`
- `transition` → `transitionProps.transition`
- `transitionDuration` → `transitionProps.duration`
- `transitionTimingFunction` → `transitionProps.timingFunction`

`Modal` styles API changes:

- `modal` selector was renamed to `content`

`Drawer` styles API changes:

- `drawer` selector was renamed to `content`

### NumberInput breaking changes

[NumberInput](https://mantine.dev/core/number-input/) component types for `value`, `defaultValue`
and `onChange` props were changed. It now expects value to be `number | ''` (number or empty string) instead
of `number | undefined`. This change was made to address multiple bugs that happened because it was
not possible to differentiate controlled and uncontrolled `NumberInput`.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { NumberInput } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<number | ''>(0);
  return <NumberInput value={value} onChange={setValue} />;
}
```

### [Pagination](https://mantine.dev/core/pagination/) breaking changes

- Styles API selectors were changed
- Renamed/removed props:
  - `itemComponent` – removed, use `getItemProps` or static components instead
  - `getItemAriaLabel` – removed, use `getItemProps` prop instead
  - `initialPage` → `defaultValue`
  - `page` → `value`

### @mantine/spotlight breaking changes

[Spotlight](https://mantine.dev/others/spotlight/) component was migrated to use [Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/)
under the hood. Its Styles API selectors and some props names were changed – it now supports all [Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) component props.

Renamed props:

- `overlayBlur` → `overlayProps.blur`
- `overlayColor` → `overlayProps.color`
- `overlayOpacity` → `overlayProps.opacity`
- `exitTransitionDuration` → `transitionProps.exitDuration`
- `transition` → `transitionProps.transition`
- `transitionDuration` → `transitionProps.transition`
- `transitionTimingFunction` → `transitionProps.timingFunction`

[Spotlight](https://mantine.dev/others/spotlight/) actions are now fully controlled:

- `actions` prop no longer accept a callback function, only a list of actions
- To make register/remove features to work you will need to store actions in state

### Other breaking changes

- [Input](https://mantine.dev/core/input/) Styles API was changed – `disabled`, `invalid` and `withIcon` selectors are no longer available, they were migrated to `data-disabled`, `data-invalid` and `data-with-icon` attributes
- [PasswordInput](https://mantine.dev/core/password-input/) Styles API was changed – `invalid` and `withIcon` selectors are no longer available, use `data-invalid` and `data-with-icon` attributes with `innerInput` selector
- `invalid` prop was renamed to `error` in [Input](https://mantine.dev/core/input/) component
- [FileInput](https://mantine.dev/core/file-input/), [Select](https://mantine.dev/core/select/) and [MultiSelect](https://mantine.dev/core/multi-select/) components no longer support `clearButtonLabel` and `clearButtonTabIndex` props, use `clearButtonProps` instead to add any extra props to the clear button
- `@mantine/next` package no longer exports `NextLink` component
- [Checkbox.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/checkbox/), [Switch.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/switch/) and [Radio.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/radio/) components no longer include [Group](https://mantine.dev/core/group/) – `orientation`, `offset` and `spacing` props are no longer supported. This change gives you more freedom on how to organize inputs layout.
- [Chip.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/chip/) no longer includes `Group` – you need to manage layout on your side
- [List](https://mantine.dev/core/list/) component Styles API was changed, it no longer has `withIcon` selector, use `data-with-icon` attribute instead
- `withFocusReturn` prop was renamed to `returnFocus` in [Modal](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) and [Drawer](https://mantine.dev/core/drawer/) components
- [Card](https://mantine.dev/core/card/) component now uses `padding` prop instead of `p` to offset `Card.Section` components
