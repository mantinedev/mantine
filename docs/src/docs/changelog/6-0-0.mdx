## createStyles breaking changes

[createStyles](https://mantine.dev/styles/create-styles/) function no longer receives `getRef`
as a third argument. Use `getStylesRef` exported from `@mantine/core` package instead:

```tsx
// in 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { createStyles } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params, getRef) => {
  child: { ref: getRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});

// in 6.x use getStylesRef function
import { createStyles, getStylesRef } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params) => {
  child: { ref: getStylesRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getStylesRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});
```

## @mantine/notifications breaking changes

[@mantine/notifications](https://mantine.dev/others/notifications/) package no longer exports
`NotificationsProvider` component. Instead you should add `Notifications` component to any
part of your application. This change allows to avoid unnecessary rerenders of child components
when notifications state change. Also `useNotifications` hook is no longer exported from the package.

```tsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { Notifications } from '@mantine/notifications';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider withNormalizeCSS withGlobalStyles>
      <Notifications />
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

## @mantine/rte package deprecation

`@mantine/rte` package is deprecated – it will no longer receive updates (last version will remain 5.x)
and it may no longer be compatible with `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks` packages (6.x and later versions).
Migrate to [@mantine/tiptap](https://mantine.dev/others/tiptap/) as soon as possible.

## @mantine/dates breaking changes

All components from `@mantine/dates` package were rebuilt from scratch.
Note that the following list is not full as it is difficult to include all breaking changes
after a full package revamp – follow documentation of component that you use to find out about
all breaking changes.

- Styles API selectors of components were changed
- `DatePicker` component was renamed to `DatePickerInput`
- `Calendar` component was renamed to `DatePicker`
- `TimeInput` component was migrated to native `input[type="time"]` as it provides better UX in most browsers
- `TimeRangeInput` component was removed – it is no longer exported from the package
- `DateRangePicker` and `RangeCalendar` components were removed – you can now setup dates range picking in [DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) and [DatePickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker-input/)
- `amountOfMonths` prop was renamed to `numberOfColumns` in all components
- `DatePickerInput` (previously `DatePicker`) component no longer supports `allowFreeInput` prop – use [DateInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-input/) component instead
- `DatePicker` (previously `Calendar`) component no longer supports `dayClassName` and `dayStyle` props – use `getDayProps` instead

## Theme object changes

You can no longer define `dateFormat` and `datesLocale` in [theme](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/),
use components prop to specify format instead:

```tsx
// 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={{ dateFormat: 'MMMM DD YYYY', datesLocale: 'es' }}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}

// 6.x – use components props
import { DatePickerInput } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  return <DatePickerInput valueFormat="MMMM D, YYYY" locale="es" />;
}
```

## Other breaking changes

- [Text](https://mantine.dev/core/text/) no longer supports `variant="link"`, use [Anchor](https://mantine.dev/core/anchor/) instead
- [Input](https://mantine.dev/core/input/) Styles API was changed – `disabled`, `invalid` and `withIcon` selectors are no longer available, they were migrated to `data-disabled`, `data-invalid` and `data-with-icon` attributes
- [PasswordInput](https://mantine.dev/core/password-input/) Styles API was changed – `invalid` and `withIcon` selectors are no longer available, use `data-invalid` and `data-with-icon` attributes with `innerInput` selector
- `invalid` prop was renamed to `error` in [Input](https://mantine.dev/core/input/) component
- [FileInput](https://mantine.dev/core/file-input/), [Select](https://mantine.dev/core/select/) and [MultiSelect](https://mantine.dev/core/multi-select/) components no longer support `clearButtonLabel` and `clearButtonTabIndex` props, use `clearButtonProps` instead to add any extra props to the clear button
- `@mantine/next` package no longer exports `NextLink` component
- [Checkbox.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/checkbox/), [Switch.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/switch/) and [Radio.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/radio/) components no longer include [Group](https://mantine.dev/core/group/) – `orientation`, `offset` and `spacing` props are no longer supported. This change gives you more freedom on how to organize inputs layout.
- [Chip.Group](https://mantine.dev/core/chip/) no longer includes `Group` – you need to manage layout on your side
- [List](https://mantine.dev/core/list/) component Styles API was changed, it no longer has `withIcon` selector, use `data-with-icon` attribute instead

## Variants and sizes on MantineProvider

You can now use [MantineProvider](https://mantine.dev/theming/mantine-provider/) to add variants to all Mantine components that support [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/)
and sizes to components that support `size` prop.

## Updated @mantine/dates package

`@mantine/dates` package was rebuilt from scratch, it now includes new components to
pick [year](https://mantine.dev/dates/year-picker/), [month](https://mantine.dev/dates/month-picker/)
and [dates](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/). All new pickers support `type` prop that can be:

- `default` – `Date | null` – user can pick one date
- `multiple` – `Date[]` – user can pick any number of dates
- `range` – `[Date | null, Date | null]` – user can pick a range of two dates
