## Tiptap rich text editor

New [@mantine/tiptap](https://mantine.dev/others/tiptap/) package is a replacement
for [@mantine/rte](https://mantine.dev/others/rte/) package. `RichTextEditor`
component is now based on [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/), it supports all of
[Tiptap extensions](https://tiptap.dev/extensions) and provides flexible components API.

## @mantine/rte package deprecation

Quill based [RichTextEditor](https://mantine.dev/others/rte/) is now deprecated.
`@mantine/rte` package will no longer receive any updates, support for it
will be discontinued when 6.0.0 version is released. We recommend to switch
to [Tiptap](https://mantine.dev/others/tiptap/) based editor as soon as possible.

- [use-toggle](https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-toggle/) hook can now handle unlimited number of options
- [ColorPicker](https://mantine.dev/core/color-picker/) and [ColorInput](https://mantine.dev/core/color-input/) components now support `hexa` format
