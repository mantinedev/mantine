## Setup project locally

This guide will help you setup project on your machine and explain how Mantine is built.

To start Mantine on your machine:

- Fork [mantine on Github](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine) and clone the repository
- Run `nvm use` to set node version (see [nvm repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installation instructions)
- Install dependencies with `yarn` (postinstall script will also install docs dependencies)
- Run `npm run storybook` to start storybook and `npm run docs` to start documentation

If you experience any issues during setup, please, [open an issue](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/new).

## Commit convention

As this project is a monorepo it is important to write correct commit messages to keep git history clean.
All commits made in this repository are divided in 3 groups:

- **package commits** related to particular package
- **docs commits** related to documentation
- **core commits** only related to repository tooling and not associated with any package

Commit message consists of 3 parts:

```
[area] Optional title: Message
```

Examples:

- `[core] Fix documentation deployment script` – Change made in repository script, it is not related to documentation or any package
- `[docs] Update report issues link` – Change related to documentation website
- `[@mantine/core] Button: Add theme focus styles` – Change in `@mantine/core` package at Button component
- `[@mantine/hooks] use-list-state: Add remove handler` – Change in `@mantine/hooks` package at use-list-state hook

## How to open pull request

Please keep pull requests small and focused on specific issue.

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/issues/new) and describe the problem you will solve.
- Setup project locally
- Create new branch out of `master` branch with name that best describes your changes
- Make changes and commit them following commit convention
- If you create new feature or fix a bug, please, include tests where possible
- Run tests with `npm test` script and make sure they are passing
- Create pull request

## Mantine architecture

This part is dedicated to mantine architecture,
read it to get better understanding of how Mantine is built, deployed and released.

### Dependencies management

Mantine is a monorepo, it contains all packages and docs in single repository.
Dependencies are managed with [yarn v1 workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

To manage dependencies more easily all of them are first added to [main package.json](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/package.json)
and only then added to individual packages based on needs.
For the same reason packages do not have any dev dependencies, all these dependencies are listed in [main package.json](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/package.json).

To assure that all dependencies are in sync [syncpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syncpack)
is used as part of testing script.

### Shared tooling

Mantine monorepo has shared [tooling configuration](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/tree/master/configuration) for all packages. It includes

- Webpack config generator
- Jest configuration
- TypeScript configuration
- ESLint and prettier configurations
- Storybook
- Syncpack
- .gitignore

Since all tooling is managed on larger scale, individual package always
includes only readme, package.json, \_tsconfig.json and src folder.
This approach keeps project simple and prevents duplication of dependencies and large chunks of configuration code.

### Packages resolution

Mantine packages are located in [src folder](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/tree/master/src).
Packages are divided in two groups: public and private. Public packages (e.g, `@mantine/hooks`, `@mantine/core`) are published to npm,
private packages (e.g., `@mantine/demos`, `@mantine/tests`) are used as utilities for public packages or docs.

All packages are resolved with [TypeScript paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)
in [tsconfig](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/tsconfig.json)
and can be imported with regular syntax `import { Button } from '@mantine/core';`
from anywhere in project, including tests, docs and other packages.

### npm scripts

All npm scripts are located at [main package.json](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/package.json),
individual packages do not have dedicated scripts.

#### Development scripts

- `storybook` – starts storybook development server
- `docs` – starts docs development server

#### Testing scripts

- `syncpack` – runs [syncpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syncpack)
- `typecheck` – runs TypeScript typechecking with `tsc --noEmit` on all packages and docs
- `lint` – runs ESLint on src folder
- `jest` – runs tests with jest
- `test` – runs all above testing scripts

#### Docs scripts

- `docs:docgen` – generates components types information with [docgen script](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/scripts/docgen.ts)
- `docs:sizes` – generates bundle size information for all packages
- `docs:clean` – runs `gatsby clean`
- `docs:build` – runs all above docs scripts and build production docs bundle
- `docs:deploy` – runs all above docs scripts and deploys docs to Github Pages

#### Release scripts

- `build` – builds given package, for example, `npm run build @mantine/core` to build single package or `npm run build all` to build all public packages
- `clean` – removes dist folder from all packages
- `release:patch` – releases 1.1.x patch version to npm
- `release:minor` – releases 1.x.0 minor version to npm
- `release:major` – releases x.0.0 major version to npm
