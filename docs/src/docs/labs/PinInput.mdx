## Usage

Use PasswordInput when you need to get a PIN-like input from user like codes.
Each block can contain 1 letter, when a value is entered, focus is moved automatically to the next input, until all fields are filled.
By `length` prop you have control of blocks amount. `PinInput` shares API with `Input` component.

<Demo data={PinInputDemos.usage} />

## Focus management

By default, `PinInput` moves focus automatically to the next input once a field is filled.
It also transfers focus to a previous input when `Delete` is pressed with focus on an empty input.

To disable this behavior, set `manageFocus` to false

<Demo data={PinInputDemos.focus} />

## Type

You can control input format with `type` prop. Mantine provides 2
RegExp validators `alphanumeric` and `number` but if that does not fit your need you can pass your own RegExp validation.
By default, `alphanumeric` symbols are allowed.

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@mantine/core';

function PinInputDemo() {
  return <PinInput type="number" />;
}
```

## Placeholder

To customize the default input placeholder `●`, pass the placeholder prop and set it to your desired placeholder.

<Demo data={PinInputDemos.placeholder} />

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@mantine/core';

function PinInputDemo() {
  return <PinInput placeholder="⭐️" />;
}
```

## Copy & Paster

Copy a text - `test` and paste it into the example input above.
By typing manually, you can change only one input at the same time. When it receives a longer string by pasting into it `PinInput` validate the string and fill all of the fields `starting always on the first input`

<Demo data={PinInputDemos.usage} />

## One time code

The operating system exposes the last received SMS code to be used by applications like your keyboard.
If the current form input asks for this code, your keyboard adapts and proposes the code as keyboard-suggestion.
Prop `oneTimeCode` makes your input setting `autocomplete="one-time-code"` what allows using that feature.

```tsx
import { PinInput } from '@mantine/core';

function OneTimeCodeInput() {
  return <PinInput oneTimeCode />;
}
```
