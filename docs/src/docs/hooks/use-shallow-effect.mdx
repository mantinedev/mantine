## Usage

use-shallow-effect hook provides functionality and signature similar to useEffect but is
triggered based on shallow-comparison of elements in dependency array, not referential equality.

```tsx
import { useShallowEffect } from '@mantine/hooks';

// the callback passed to use-shallow-effect will be called
//on shallow comparison between the elements inside the dependency array.
useShallowEffect(() => {

}, [elem1, elem2])
```

## Example

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useShallowEffect } from '@mantine/hooks';
import { Card, Image, Text } from '@mantine/core'

function ShallowEffectDemo({ url }) {
    const [ data, setData ] = useState([]);

    //similar to useEffect hook, performing all side-effects 
    //in using the use-shallow-effect hook.
    useShallowEffect(() => {
        const getData = async () => {
            const result = await axios.get(url);
            setState(result.data)
        }
    })

  return (
    data.map((elem) => (
        <Card>
            <Image
                src={elem.url}
                height={160}
                alt={elem.name}
            />
            <Text weight={500}>{elem.name}</Text>
        </Card>
    ))
  );
}
```

## Shallow Comparison

Unlike useEffect which performs a referential comparison to trigger the callback,
useShallowEffect performs a shallow comparison.

Shallow Comparison in words - 

1. Simple '===' comparison for primitive types like number,string etc.
2. For objects and arrays same '===' comparison between the keys or elements respectively.

## Supported Types

Currently support shallow comparison between primitive types, objects and arrays.


```tsx
useShallowEffect: void (
cb: () => void,
deps: React.DependencyList
);
```
