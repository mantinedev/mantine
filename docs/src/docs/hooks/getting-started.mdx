## Browser support

All hooks are tested to work in all major modern browsers. Some hooks depend on web APIs that may not be supported by old browsers:

- use-media-query, use-color-scheme and use-reduced-motion hooks rely on [window.matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
  API
- use-clipboard hook uses [Navigator.clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/clipboard)
