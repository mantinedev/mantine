## Usage

Use `use-headroom` hook to create headers that are hidden after user scrolls past given distance in px.
The hook returns a boolean value that determines whether element should be pinned or hidden.
Hook returns `true` when current scroll position is less than specified `fixedAt` value and
after user scrolled up.

function useHeadroom(input?: {
  /** Number in px at which element should be fixed */
  fixedAt?: number;

  /** Called when element is pinned */
  onPin?(): void;

  /** Called when element is at fixed position */
  onFix?(): void;

  /** Called when element is unpinned */
  onRelease?(): void;
}): boolean;
```
