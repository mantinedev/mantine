## Usage

use-focus-return automatically manages focus returning to last focused element when given condition is met.
For example it is used in [Modal](/core/modal/) component to restore focus after modal was closed.

Try closing modal with `Escape` key and see how focus returns to button after modal closes:

<Demo data={ModalDemos.usage} demoProps={{ toggle: true }} />

In most cases you would want to use this hook with [use-focus-trap](/hooks/use-focus-trap/).

```tsx
useFocusReturn({
  // Is region with focus trap active?
  // When it activates hook saves document.activeElement to internal state
  // and focuses this element once focus trap is deactivated
  opened: false,

  // Determines whether focus should be returned automatically, true by default
  shouldReturnFocus: true,
});
```

If `shouldReturnFocus` option is set to `false` you can call returned function to focus last active element:

```tsx
const returnFocus = useFocusReturn({
  opened: false,
  shouldReturnFocus: false,
});

// ... later
returnFocus();
```

## Definition

```tsx
function useFocusReturn(options: { opened: boolean; shouldReturnFocus?: boolean }): () => void;
```
