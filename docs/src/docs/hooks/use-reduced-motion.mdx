## Usage

use-reduced-motion detects if user [prefers to reduce motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion).
It uses <GatsbyLink to="/hooks/use-media-query/">use-media-query</GatsbyLink> hook under the hood.
Hook relies on `window.matchMedia()` [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
and will always return false if api is not available (e.g. during server side rendering).

Use hook to detect if user prefers to reduce motion (`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` media query) and set animations duration based on this value.
All Mantine components which use animations support it by default:
