## Usage

`use-focus-within` hook detects if any element within has focus, it works the same way as `:focus-within` CSS selector:

<Demo data={HooksDemos.useFocusWithinDemo} />

## Definition

```tsx
function useFocusWithin<T extends HTMLElement = any>(handlers?: {
  onFocus?(event: FocusEvent): void;
  onBlur?(event: FocusEvent): void;
}): {
  ref: React.MutableRefObject<T>;
  focused: boolean;
};
```
