## Usage

`Dialog` is a simplified version of [Modal](/core/modal/) component.
It does not include most of accessibility and usability [Modal](/core/modal/) features:

- Focus trap is not available
- Does not close on click outside
- Does not have overlay

Use `Dialog` to attract attention with not important information or action,
for example, you can create an email subscription form:

<Demo data={DialogDemos.usage} />

## Change position

`Dialog` is rendered in [Portal](/core/portal/) and has fixed position, set `position` prop to control dialog's position:

```tsx
// Dialog in top left corner
<Dialog position={{ top: 20, left: 20 }} />

// Dialog in bottom left corner
<Dialog position={{ bottom: 20, left: 20 }} />
```

## Paper props

`Dialog` supports all props from [Paper](/core/paper/) component,
you can customize `shadow`, `padding` and `radius` same way.

```tsx
<Dialog shadow="xl" p={30} radius="sm" />
```

## Change transition

`Dialog` supports all transitions from [Transition](/core/transition/) component.
To change transition provide following props:

- **transition** – predefined transition name or transition object
- **transitionDuration** – transition duration in ms, defaults to 200ms
- **transitionTimingFunction** – timing function, defaults to `theme.transitionTimingFunction`

```tsx
<Dialog transition="slide-up" transitionDuration={300} transitionTimingFunction="ease" />
```

## Accessibility

`Dialog` is not accessible and most likely will not be announced by screen reader,
make sure you do not put any important information. In most cases it would be much better
to select [Modal](/core/modal/), [Drawer](/core/drawer/) or [Notifications](/others/notifications/).
