## Usage

<Demo data={ModalDemos.usage} />

## Remove title and close button

You can remove modal title and close button.
It will still be possible to close modal by clicking on overlay or pressing escape.

<Demo data={ModalDemos.header} />

## Center modal vertically

<Demo data={ModalDemos.centered} />

## Change size

You can change modal width by setting `size` prop to predefined size or any valid width, for example, 55% or 200px.
Size controls modal width, max-width is set to 100% with spacing on left and right, no matter what `size` is passed 100% will not be exceeded:

```tsx
<Modal size="sm" /> // -> predefined small size
<Modal size={378} /> // -> size in px
<Modal size="55%" /> // -> size in %
<Modal size="calc(100vw - 87px)" /> // -> size with calc
<Modal size="255%" /> // -> max-width is set to 100%, won't work
```

<Demo data={ModalDemos.sizes} />

## Customize overlay

Modal uses [Overlay](/core/overlay/) component, you can change overlay opacity, blur and color:

<Demo data={ModalDemos.overlay} />

## Modal with overflow

You can control modal vertical overflow behavior by setting `overflow` prop:

<Demo data={ModalDemos.overflow} />

## Change transitions

Modal is built with [Transition](/core/transition/) component.

You can change transitions with props:

- **transition** – predefined transition name or transition object
- **transitionDuration** – transition duration in ms, defaults to 300ms. Note that, modal has two elements which are animated: overlay and modal body. Overlay changes opacity during transition and its animation is twice as fast as modal body.
- **transitionTimingFunction** – timing function, defaults to `theme.transitionTimingFunction`

<Demo data={ModalDemos.transitions} />

## Initial focus

Modal uses [use-focus-trap](/hooks/use-focus-trap/) to manage focus.
To specify initial focus element add `data-autofocus` attribute:

```tsx
<Modal>
  <input />
  {/* Second input in modal will have initial focus */}
  <input data-autofocus />
  <input />
</Modal>
```

## Control behavior

The following props can be used to control Modal behavior.
In most cases you should not turn these features off as it will make your modal less accessible.

- `trapFocus` – defines whether focus should be trapped inside modal
- `closeOnEscape` – defines whether modal should be closed when user presses `Escape` key
- `closeOnClickOutside` – defines whether modal should be closed when user clicks outside of modal body

## Accessibility and usability

- When modal is opened, focus is trapped inside and vertical scroll is locked at current position
- When user clicks on overlay or presses escape modal closes
- Modal transitions are disabled if user prefers to reduce motion
- Modal wrapper has `aria-modal="true"` and `role="dialog"` attributes
- Modal wrapper has `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` pointing to modal title and body

For better screen reader support set `closeButtonLabel` prop:

```tsx
// sets title attribute on close button
<Modal closeButtonLabel="Close authentication modal" />
```
