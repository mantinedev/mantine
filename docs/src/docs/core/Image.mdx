## Usage

Image component is a wrapper around img element with option to change object fit, radius and placeholder:

<Demo data={ImageDemos.usage} />

## Width and height

In the example above, the image takes 100% of the width of its container and height is calculated dynamically based on image proportion.
To change this behavior, set image width and height to define image size.

Note that if image proportions do not match the given width and height, some parts will be cut out.
In case you want to show the image with its original proportions and want it to fit in the current width and height, set `fit="contain"`:

<Demo data={ImageDemos.sizes} />

## Placeholder

By default, image placeholders are disabled.
Image placeholder is displayed in these cases:

- `withPlaceholder` prop is set to true
- Error occurred during image loading (e.g. broken link)
- Image did not receive `src` prop

To customize image placeholder pass any react node to `placeholder` prop.
Placeholder size is determined by width and height props.
Placeholder is centered vertically and horizontally across provided width and height.

<Demo data={ImageDemos.placeholders} />

## With caption

You can add figcaption to an image with `caption` prop:

<Demo data={ImageDemos.caption} />

## Get refs

You can get both image and root element (`div`) refs with `ref` and `imageRef` props:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Image } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  const imageRef = useRef<HTMLImageElement>(null);
  const rootRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  return <Image ref={rootRef} imageRef={imageRef} />;
}
```
