## Usage

Use Space component to add horizontal or vertical spacing between elements:

<Demo data={SpaceDemos.horizontal} />

<br />

<Demo data={SpaceDemos.vertical} />

## Where to use

In most cases, you would want to use margin props instead of Space when working with Mantine components:

```tsx
<Text>First line</Text>
// <Space h="md" /> is not required as the same can be achieved with margin
<Text mt="md">Second line</Text>
```

But when you work with regular HTML elements you do not have access to `theme.spacing` and you may want to use
Space component to skip direct theme subscription:

```tsx
<div>First line</div>
<Space h="md" />
// Margin props are not available on div, use Space to add spacing from theme
<div>Second line</div>
```
