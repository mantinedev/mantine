## Usage

`Transition` component allow you to work with enter/exit animations.
Component comes with premade animations and option to create your own based on CSS properties.

### Premade transitions

Mantine includes several premade transitions:

<Demo data={TooltipDemos.transitions} />

To use one of them set `transition` property to one of these values:

```tsx
import { Transition } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo({ opened }) {
  return (
    <Transition mounted={opened} transition="fade" duration={400} timingFunction="ease">
      {(styles) => <div style={styles}>Your modal</div>}
    </Transition>
  );
}
```

### Custom transitions

You can create your own transition. `transition` is an object with 4 properties:

- `in` – styles for mounted state
- `out` – styles for unmounted state
- `common` (optional) – styles for both mounted and unmounted states
- `transitionProperty` – properties which participate in transition

<Demo data={TransitionDemos.custom} />
