## Usage

Card component is a wrapper around [Paper](/core/paper/) component
with context styles for CardSection component.
Combine Card component with other Mantine components to create cards with your design requirements:

<Demo data={CardDemos.usage} />

## CardSection

CardSection is a special component that is used to remove Card padding from its children while other elements still have horizontal spacing.
CardSection works the following way:

- It component is a first child in Card then it has negative top, left and right margins
- If it is a last child in Card then it has negative bottom, left and right margins
- If it is in the middle then only left and right margins will be negative

```tsx
<Card padding="xl">
  {/* top, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <CardSection>First section</CardSection>

  {/* Content that is not inside CardSection will have theme.spacing.xl spacing on all sides relative to Card */}
  <Text>Some other content</Text>

  {/* right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <CardSection>Middle section</CardSection>

  {/* bottom, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <CardSection>Last section</CardSection>
</Card>
```

Note that Card relies on mapping direct children and you cannot use fragments or others wrappers for CardSection:

```tsx
<Card padding="xl">
  <div>
    <CardSection>Won't work</CardSection>
  </div>

  <>
    <CardSection>Won't work either</CardSection>
  </>

  <CardSection>Works fine</CardSection>
</Card>
```

## Custom root element

You can set `component` prop on Card to use provide custom root element,
for example, you can make whole card a link:

<Demo data={CardDemos.link} />

You can also use React component instead of an element, for example, Link from react-router-dom:

```tsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Card } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return <Card component={Link} to="/my-route/" />;
}
```

## Usage with Next Link

Next Link component requires `ref` prop usage, however all Mantine components use `elementRef`,
to make Card and other similar components work with Next Link, create wrapper component in your components folder:

```tsx
// This component can be reused in every Mantine component which supports component pass through
import React, { forwardRef } from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';

export const NextLink = forwardRef(
  (
    { href, ...others }: React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Link>,
    ref: React.ForwardedRef<HTMLAnchorElement>
  ) => (
    <Link href={href}>
      {/* eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/anchor-has-content */}
      <a {...others} ref={ref} />
    </Link>
  )
);
```

And then pass it to Card or other component:

```tsx
<Card component={NextLink} href="/hello" />
```

## Get element ref

You can get root element ref by setting `elementRef` prop:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Card } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  const ref = useRef();
  return <Card elementRef={ref} />;
}
```

## TypeScript

You need to pass additional types to use custom component with TypeScript
in case you need full type coverage for events and `elementRef`:

```tsx
// With element
<Card<'a', HTMLAnchorElement>
  component="a"
  onClick={(event) => console.log(event)}
  elementRef={(node) => {
    window.myRef = node;
  }}
/>

// With component
<Card<typeof Link, HTMLAnchorElement>
  component={Link}
  onClick={(event) => console.log(event)}
  elementRef={(node) => {
    window.myRef = node;
  }}
/>
```
