## Usage

Card component is a wrapper around [Paper](/core/paper/) component with context styles for `Card.Section` component:

<Demo data={CardDemos.usage} />

## Card.Section

Card.Section is a special component that is used to remove Card padding from its children while other elements still have horizontal spacing.
Card.Section works the following way:

- If component is a first child in Card then it has negative top, left and right margins
- If it is a last child in Card then it has negative bottom, left and right margins
- If it is in the middle then only left and right margins will be negative

```tsx
<Card p="xl">
  {/* top, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <Card.Section>First section</Card.Section>

  {/* Content that is not inside Card.Section will have theme.spacing.xl spacing on all sides relative to Card */}
  <Text>Some other content</Text>

  {/* right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <Card.Section>Middle section</Card.Section>

  {/* bottom, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <Card.Section>Last section</Card.Section>
</Card>
```

Note that Card relies on mapping direct children and you cannot use fragments or others wrappers for `Card.Section`:

```tsx
<Card p="xl">
  <div>
    <Card.Section>Won't work</Card.Section>
  </div>

  <>
    <Card.Section>Won't work either</Card.Section>
  </>

  <Card.Section>Works fine</Card.Section>
</Card>
```

- `inheritPadding` prop will add the same left and right padding to `Card.Section` as set in `Card` component

<Demo data={CardDemos.section} />
