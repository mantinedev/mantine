## Usage

Card component is a wrapper around [Paper](/core/paper/) component
with context styles for Card.Section component.
Combine Card component with other Mantine components to create cards with your design requirements:

<Demo data={CardDemos.usage} />

## Card.Section

Card.Section is a special component that is used to remove Card padding from its children while other elements still have horizontal spacing.
Card.Section works the following way:

- It component is a first child in Card then it has negative top, left and right margins
- If it is a last child in Card then it has negative bottom, left and right margins
- If it is in the middle then only left and right margins will be negative

```tsx
<Card padding="xl">
  {/* top, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <Card.Section>First section</Card.Section>

  {/* Content that is not inside Card.Section will have theme.spacing.xl spacing on all sides relative to Card */}
  <Text>Some other content</Text>

  {/* right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <Card.Section>Middle section</Card.Section>

  {/* bottom, right, left margins are negative – -1 * theme.spacing.xl */}
  <Card.Section>Last section</Card.Section>
</Card>
```

Note that Card relies on mapping direct children and you cannot use fragments or others wrappers for Card.Section:

```tsx
<Card padding="xl">
  <div>
    <Card.Section>Won't work</Card.Section>
  </div>

  <>
    <Card.Section>Won't work either</Card.Section>
  </>

  <Card.Section>Works fine</Card.Section>
</Card>
```

## Custom root element

You can set `component` prop on Card to use provide custom root element,
for example, you can make whole card a link:

<Demo data={CardDemos.link} />

You can also use React component instead of an element, for example, Link from react-router-dom:

```tsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Card } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return <Card component={Link} to="/my-route/" />;
}
```

To use custom component with TypeScript provide type:

```tsx
// With element
<Card<'a'>
  component="a"
  onClick={(event) => console.log(event)}
  ref={(node) => {
    window.myRef = node;
  }}
/>

// With component
<Card<typeof Link>
  component={Link}
  onClick={(event) => console.log(event)}
  ref={(node) => {
    window.myRef = node;
  }}
/>
```

## Custom Card.Section root element

Card.Section root element can be changed the same way as with Card:

<Demo data={CardDemos.linkSection} />

## Get root element ref

You can get root element ref by setting `ref` prop:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Card } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  const ref = useRef();
  return <Card ref={ref} />;
}
```
