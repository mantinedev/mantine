title: 'Accordion component error'
error: 'Accordion.Item component was not found in the tree'
---

## Error source

You have rendered `Accordion.Control` or `Accordion.Panel` component outside of `Accordion.Item` component context:

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@mantine/core';

function DemoWithError() {
  return (
    <>
      <Accordion.Control>Item 1</Accordion.Control>
      <Accordion.Panel>Panel 1</Accordion.Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

## How to fix

Make sure that all `Accordion.Control` and `Accordion.Panel` components
are rendered within `Accordion.Item` component – all of them require context to work correctly:

```tsx
import { Accordion } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <Accordion.Item value="item-1">
      <Accordion.Control>Item 1</Accordion.Control>
      <Accordion.Panel>Panel 1</Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion.Item>
  );
}
```
