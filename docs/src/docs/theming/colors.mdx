# Colors

Mantine uses [open-color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) in default theme with some additions.
Each color has 10 shades.

Colors are exposed on theme object as an array of strings,
you can access color shade by color name and index (0-9), colors with larger index are darker:

```tsx
theme.colors.red[5];
theme.colors.gray[9];
theme.colors.blue[0];
```

## Adding extra colors

You can add extra colors. This will allow you to use these colors with all components which support color change,
for example, [Button](/core/button/), [Badge](/core/badge/) or [Switch](/core/switch/).

Note that all colors should **always have 10 shades**.
You can use some of these tools to generate or copy ready color palettes:

- [Themera](https://themera.vercel.app/)
- [Material Design Colors](https://www.materialui.co/colors)
- [Omatsuri](https://omatsuri.app/color-shades-generator)
- [Smart Swatch](https://smart-swatch.netlify.app/)
