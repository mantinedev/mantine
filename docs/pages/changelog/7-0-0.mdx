## Migration to native CSS

Mantine no longer depends on [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) for styles generation. All `@mantine/*`
packages are now shipped with native CSS files which can be imported from `@mantine/{package}/styles.css`,
for example:

```tsx
import '@mantine/core/styles.css';
```

This change improves performance, reduces bundle size of the library and allows using Mantine
in environments where CSS-in-JS is not supported (or supported with limitations), for example,
Next.js app directory.

Important breaking changes:

- `createStyles` function is no longer available, use [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules) or any other styling solution of your choice instead
- Components no longer support `sx` prop. You can use `className` or `style` props instead.
- `styles` prop no longer supports nested selectors

It is now recommended to use [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules) to style Mantine components.
To update your project to [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules), follow the [6.x → 7.x migration guide](/guides/6x-to-7x).

## Vanilla extract integration

If you prefer CSS-in-JS syntax for styling, you can use [Vanilla extract](/styles/vanilla-extract)
as a TypeScript CSS preprocessor. You will be able to use most of Mantine styling features
with [Vanilla extract](/styles/vanilla-extract).

## System color scheme support

All components now support system color scheme – when `colorScheme` value is `auto`,
components will use `prefers-color-scheme` media query to determine if the user prefers light or dark color scheme.

Note that `auto` is not the default value. You need to set it manually to enable system color scheme support
both on [MantineProvider](/theming/mantine-provider) and in [ColorSchemeScript](/theming/color-schemes#colorschemescript):

```tsx
import { MantineProvider, ColorSchemeScript } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <>
      <ColorSchemeScript defaultColorScheme="auto" />
      <MantineProvider defaultColorScheme="auto">
        <App />
      </MantineProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Built-in color scheme manager

[MantineProvider](/theming/mantine-provider) now comes with a built-in color scheme manager.
It is no longer required to use any other components to set up color scheme logic.
Color scheme can be changed with [useMantineColorScheme hook](/theming/color-schemes#use-mantine-color-scheme-hook):

<Demo data={ThemingDemos.colorScheme} />

## CSS modules and PostCSS preset

[CSS modules](/styles/css-modules) is now the recommended way to style Mantine components,
although it is not required – you can choose any other styling solution of your choice.

It is also recommended to use [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset). It includes
mixins and functions to simplify styling of Mantine components. [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset)
is included in all templates.

## Global styles

Mantine no longer includes normalize.css. Instead, it uses a bare minimum set of [global styles](/styles/global-styles).
These styles are part of the `@mantine/core` package and are applied automatically when you import
`@mantine/core/styles.css` in your application. Note that these styles cannot be decoupled from the
rest of the library.

## Mantine as a headless UI library

You can now use Mantine as a [headless](/styles/unstyled) library. To achieve that, just do not import
`@mantine/*/styles.css` in your application. Then you will be able to apply styles with
[Styles API](/styles/styles-api).

## createTheme function

`createTheme` function is a replacement for `MantineThemeOverride` type. Use it to create a theme
override, it will give you autocomplete for all theme properties:

```tsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const theme = createTheme({
  fontFamily: 'sans-serif',
  primaryColor: 'orange',
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

## Components extend functions

All components that support [default props](/theming/default-props) or [Styles API](/styles/styles-api) now have a static `extend` function which allows getting autocomplete when customizing
[defaultProps](/theming/default-props), [classNames and styles](/styles/styles-api) of the component
on [theme](/theming/theme-object):

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { TextInput, MantineProvider, createTheme } from '@mantine/core';
import classes from './Demo.module.css';

const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    TextInput: TextInput.extends({
      styles: (theme, props) => ({
        input: {
          fontSize: props.size === 'compact' ? theme.fontSizes.sm : undefined,
        }
      })
      classNames: {
        root: classes.root,
        input: classes.input,
        label: classes.label,
      },

      defaultProps: {
        size: 'compact',
      },
    }),
  },
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

## classNames based on component props

You can now get component props in [classNames and styles](/styles/styles-api) to conditionally apply styles.
This feature is a more powerful replacement for styles params.

<Demo data={StylesDemos.classNamesProps} />

## Components CSS variables

You can now customize components [CSS variables](/styles/styles-api) to change component styles based on its props.
For example, it can be used to add new [sizes](/styles/variants-sizes):

<Demo data={StylesDemos.vars} />

## New variants system

All components now have `data-variant` attribute on the root element, even if the component does not have any predefined variants.
You can use it to apply styles to all components of the same type on [theme](/theming/theme-object):

<Demo data={StylesDemos.customVariant} />

## New sizes system

There are multiple ways to customize component sizes:

- With `data-size` attribute
- With component [CSS variables](/styles/styles-api)
- With [static CSS variables](/styles/variants-sizes#sizes-with-static-css-variables)

Example of customizing [Button](/core/button) size with `data-size` attribute:

<Demo data={StylesDemos.dataSize} />

## theme.variantColorResolver

[Button](/core/button), [Badge](/core/badge), [ActionIcon](/core/action-icon), [ThemeIcon](/core/theme-icon) and other
components now support custom variants with [variantColorResolver](/theming/colors#colors-variant-resolver)
– it supports both changing colors of existing variants and adding new variants.

<Demo data={ThemingDemos.variantColorsResolver} />

## rem units scaling

It is now possible to scale [rem](/styles/rem#rem-units-scaling) units. It is useful when you want to change
font-size of `html`/`:root` element and preserve Mantine components sizes. For example, if you would like to set `html` font-size to `10px` and scale Mantine components accordingly, you need
to set `scale` to `1 / (10 / 16)` (16 – default font-size) = `1 / 0.625` = `1.6`:

```css
:root {
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

```tsx
import { MantineProvider, createTheme } from '@mantine/core';

const theme = createTheme({
  scale: 1.6,
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

## color prop improvements

All components that support `color` prop now support the following color values:

- Key of `theme.colors`, for example, `blue`
- `theme.colors` index reference, for example, `blue.5`
- Any valid CSS color value, for example, `#fff`, `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`, `hsl(0, 0%, 100%)`

<Demo data={ThemingDemos.colorProp} />

## Components classes

Classes of each component are now available in `Component.classes` object. For example, you can
find [Button](/core/button) classes in `Button.classes`:

<DataTable
  head={['Key', 'Class']}
  data={Object.keys(Button.classes).map((key) => [key, Button.classes[key]])}
/>

You can use these classes to create components with the same styles as Mantine components:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return <button type="button" className={Button.classes.root} />;
}
```

## Theme object changes

- `theme.lineHeight` is now `theme.lineHeights` – it is now possible to specify multiple line heights. `theme.lineHeights` values are used in the [Text](/core/text) component.
- `theme.colorScheme` is no longer available, use [useMantineColorScheme](/theming/color-schemes#use-mantine-color-scheme-hook) to get color scheme value
- `theme.dir` is no longer needed, direction is now managed by [DirectionProvider](/styles/rtl)
- `theme.loader` was removed, you can now configure default loader with [default props](/theming/default-props) of [Loader](/core/loader) component
- `theme.transitionTimingFunction` was removed
- `theme.focusRingStyles` was replaced with `theme.focusClassName`
- `theme.activeStyles` was replaced with `theme.activeClassName`
- `theme.globalStyles` was removed
- `theme.fn` functions were removed, some of the functions are available as [standalone utilities](/styles/color-functions)
- New [theme.scale](/styles/rem#rem-units-scaling) property controls rem units scaling
- New `theme.fontSmoothing` property determines whether font smoothing styles should be applied to the body element
- New [theme.variantColorResolver](/theming/colors#colors-variant-resolver) property allows customizing component colors per variant

## Colors generator

New [@mantine/colors-generator](/theming/colors#colors-generation) package is now available to generate
color palettes based on single color value. It is also available as [online tool](/colors-generator/).
Note that it is usually better to generate colors in advance to avoid contrast issues.

```tsx
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';
import { generateColors } from '@mantine/colors-generator';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider
      theme={{
        colors: {
          'pale-blue': generateColors('#375EAC'),
        },
      }}
    >
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
```

## New setup for RTL

`@mantine/core` package now exports [DirectionProvider](/styles/rtl) component, which should be used to configure the direction of the application.
`useDirection` hook can be used to toggle direction. All components now include RTL styles by default, it is no
longer required to set up additional plugins. See [RTL documentation](/styles/rtl) to learn more.

## React 18+ only

Starting from version 7.0 Mantine no longer supports older React versions. The minimum supported version is now React 18.
It is required because Mantine components now use [useId](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) and [useSyncExternalStore](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore)
hooks, which are available only in React 18.

## left and right section

Components that previously had `rightSection` and `icon` props, now use `leftSection` instead of `icon`.
Example of [Button](/core/button) sections:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <Button leftSection="left" rightSection="right">
      Label
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## NumberInput changes

[NumberInput](/core/number-input) was migrated to [react-number-format](https://s-yadav.github.io/react-number-format/).
It now supports more features and has improvements in cursor position management.
Due to migration, some of the props were renamed – follow the [documentation](/core/number-input) to learn about the changes.

<Demo data={NumberInputDemos.prefixSuffix} />

## Loader changes

[Loader](/core/loader) component is now built with CSS only. This change improves performance and reduces
HTML output of the component.

<Demo data={LoaderDemos.configurator} />

[Theme](/theming/theme-object) object no longer supports `theme.loader` property –
it is also now possible to add custom loaders on [theme](/theming/theme-object) with [default props](/theming/default-props).
Specified [Loader](/core/loader) will be used in all components that use it under the hood ([LoadingOverlay](/core/loading-overlay), [Button](/core/button), [ActionIcon](/core/action-icon), [Stepper](/core/stepper), etc.).

<Demo data={LoaderDemos.customType} />

## Progress changes

[Progress](/core/progress) component now supports compound components pattern.
Advanced features that were previously implemented in [Progress](/core/progress) are now supposed to be implemented with
compound components instead.

<Demo data={ProgressDemos.compound} />

- `loaderPosition` prop was removed, [Loader](/core/loader) is now always rendered in the center to prevent layout shifts
- Styles API selectors were changed, see [Button Styles API](/core/button?t=styles-api) documentation for more details

## AppShell changes

[AppShell](/core/app-shell) component was completely rewritten, it now supports more features:

- `AppShell` now uses compound components pattern: `Navbar`, `Aside`, `Header` and `Footer` are no longer exported from `@mantine/core` package. Instead, use `AppShell.Navbar`, `AppShell.Aside`, etc.
- `AppShell` now supports animations when navbar/aside are opened/closed
- Navbar/aside can now be collapsed on desktop – state is handled separately for mobile and desktop
- Header/footer can now be collapsed the same way as navbar/aside. For example, the header can be collapsed based on scroll position or direction.
- `AppShell` no longer supports `fixed` prop – all components have `position: fixed` styles, static positioning is no longer supported
- The documentation was updated, it now includes [10+ examples on a separate page](/app-shell?e=BasicAppShell)

## SimpleGrid changes

[SimpleGrid](/core/simple-grid) now uses object format to define grid breakpoints and spacing,
it works the same way as [style props](/styles/style-props).

<Demo data={SimpleGridDemos.responsive} />

## Grid changes

[Grid](/core/grid) now uses object format in `gutter`, `offset`, `span` and order props,
all props now work the same way as [style props](/styles/style-props).

<Demo data={CarouselDemos.breakpoints} />

## @mantine/prism deprecation

`@mantine/prism` package was deprecated in favor of `@mantine/code-highlight` package. [The new package](/others/code-highlight) uses [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) instead of [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).

<Demo data={CodeHighlightDemos.tabsGetIcons} />

## Fieldset component

New [Fieldset](/core/fieldset) component:

<Demo data={FieldsetDemos.usage} />

## Combobox component

The new [Combobox](/core/combobox) component allows building custom select, autocomplete, tags input, multiselect and other
similar components. It is used as a base for updated [Autocomplete](/core/autocomplete), [Select](/core/select),
[TagsInput](/core/tags-input) and [MultiSelect](/core/multi-select) components.

[Combobox](/core/combobox) is very flexible and allows you to have full control over the component rendering and logic.
Advanced features that were previously implemented in [Autocomplete](/core/autocomplete), [Select](/core/select)
and [MultiSelect](/core/multi-select) are now supposed to be implemented with [Combobox](/core/combobox) instead.

You can find 50+ `Combobox` examples on [this page](/combobox).

<Demo data={ComboboxDemos.select} />

## TagsInput component

New [TagsInput](/core/tags-input) component based on [Combobox](/core/combobox) component.
The component is similar to [MultiSelect](/core/multi-select) but allows entering custom values.

<Demo data={TagsInputDemos.data} />

## withErrorStyles prop

All inputs now support `withErrorStyles` prop, which allows removing error styles from the input.
It can be used to apply custom error styles without override, or use other techniques to
indicate error state. For example, it can be used to render an icon in the right section:

<Demo data={InputDemos.error} />

## hiddenFrom and visibleFrom props

All Mantine components now support `hiddenFrom` and `visibleFrom` props.
These props accept breakpoint (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) and hide the component when
viewport width is less than or greater than the specified breakpoint:

<Demo data={StylesDemos.hiddenVisible} />
